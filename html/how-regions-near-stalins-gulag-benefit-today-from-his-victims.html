Jailed for criticising the government, Solzhenitsyn was one of the 2.65m people in 1921-59 arrested for “counter-revolutionary activities” and labelled “enemies of the people” (<small>EOTP</small>).</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/087%20Graphic%20detail%20-%20The%20gulag-90840b0791e7f736647a1a13a405aa4a.mp3" title="How regions near Stalin’s gulag benefit today from his victims"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Not all <small>EOTP</small> were dissidents: simply belonging to the petite bourgeoisie often led to a trip to the gulag. As a result, <small>EOTP</small> tended to be well-educated. In 1939, 1% of census respondents and 2% of gulag inmates had university degrees. Among <small>EOTP</small> in 1927-53, the rate was 15%. Incarcerating <small>EOTP</small> thus entailed relocating much of the Soviet intelligentsia. And a new paper by Gerhard Toews of the New Economic School in Moscow and Pierre-Louis Vézina of King’s College London shows that regions where <small>EOTP</small> were jailed still reap economic benefits from this forced migration.</p><p class="article__body-text">The study began with data on the share of inmates in each of 79 prisons in 1952 who were <small>EOTP</small>. Save for nine special <small>EOTP</small> camps, political prisoners were mixed in with common criminals. Aside from a few patterns— <small>EOTP</small> tended to cluster in big prisons in thinly populated areas with weak transport links—the choice of camps where they were sent appeared random.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Next, the paper measured current levels of economic development within 30km of prison sites. It found that the greater a camp’s share of <small>EOTP</small> in 1952, the richer and better-educated people living nearby are today—even after accounting for regional differences and factors that affected where <small>EOTP</small> were sent. A ten-percentage-point increase in the share of inmates who were <small>EOTP</small> corresponded to gains of 8% in wages; 23% in profits per worker; 23 percentage points in the share of firms at which the average worker went to university; and 21% in the strength of light emitted at night per person, a measure of economic output. After the Soviet Union broke up, the number of registered firms also grew unusually fast near former camps with lots of <small>EOTP</small>.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="20211204_GDC100_2_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">To explain this trend, the authors studied where <small>EOTP</small> went after being freed. Until 1959 <small>EOTP</small> were not allowed to go home. Their “wolves’ passports” stopped them from living in big cities. As prisons became company towns, managers at state enterprises recruited ex-cons, who often stayed where they had new friends or families.</p><p class="article__body-text">No data were available on the post-prison locations of <small>EOTP</small>. But a poll in 2016 found that people living near the sites of camps with high shares of <small>EOTP</small> were especially likely to have relatives who were political prisoners. Moreover, 42% of respondents whose grandparents were <small>EOTP</small> had attended university, compared with 31% for everyone else. These data imply a cause behind the correlation. Lots of <small>EOTP</small> settled near their jails and had well-educated kids, who stayed in the same areas and spawned another educated, rich generation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Joseph Stalin did his best to wipe out perceived enemies. It might have comforted <small>EOTP</small> to know that their human capital has outlived the gulag by six decades. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text" data-interactive-class="g-interactive-source">Source: “Enemies of the people”, by Gerhard Toews and Pierre-Louis Vézina, working paper, 2021</p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline "“Levelling up” at gunpoint"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=How%20regions%20near%20Stalin%E2%80%99s%20gulag%20benefit%20today%20from%20his%20victims&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fbf6ojrni3hg7f40n4bf9vmqns5f1q33a&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body><script>
