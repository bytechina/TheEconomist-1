After two hours of football against <a href="./italys-government-basks-in-the-glow-of-footballing-success.html">Italy</a> on July 11th, the country’s football team yet again failed to win a tournament, having at last got to a final. To make matters worse, it lost—again—in a penalty shoot-out, shredding the nerves and dashing the hopes of its fans. The players who missed penalties suffered sickening abuse online.</p><p class="article__body-text">The reactions seem excessive. After all, the English pride themselves on their down-to-earth common sense. Yet they are prone to occasional bouts of a kind of delirium, when a fractious nation comes together, and it seems there is only one topic of conversation, from greasy-spoon eateries to Michelin-starred restaurants. It is striking how often in modern times these episodes have involved two institutions that, in the grand scheme of things, are rather trivial: the royal family, a constitutional monarchy that has transformed itself into a reality-television soap opera; and football, a game.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Well before the final of the Euros, held at Wembley stadium in London, St George’s flags were draped from high-rise windows and fluttered from car roof-tops. Day after day the press contained page after page of football analysis, speculation and gossip. On the day of the final, some gyms and swimming pools closed early to ensure staff and customers would not miss the game. Pubs were full as lunch-time drinkers stayed, becoming more boisterous as the day wore on. Some employers had given their workers not just an early Sunday night but a late start on Monday morning. Some primary schools made early classes on Monday morning optional, so that the children could do their patriotic duty and stay up to watch their England heroes. The government was said to be ready to declare a national holiday if England won but to have refrained for fear of jinxing the team.</p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="./football-is-giving-a-fractured-nation-a-reminder-of-what-its-like-to-come-together.html">The obsession with the game had many causes</a>. One is that this European Championship coincided in Britain with preparations for the lifting of most lockdown and social-distancing rules on July 19th. Britain in the past week has recorded some 30,000 new covid-19 infections a day, the highest number since January. In these circumstances, allowing crowds into football stadiums, including more than 60,000 into Wembley for the final, may have been reckless. But it contributed to a sense that a long, dark period was drawing to a close, and that, to greet the new dawn, the country’s football team was for once doing it proud.</p><p class="article__body-text">And, as a team, they do seem a bunch to be proud of. In the past, many English players off the pitch have seemed spoiled, entitled and prone to yobbish and drunken behaviour. It is true that one of this team, Harry Maguire, was found guilty last year of assaulting and trying to bribe the police on the Greek island of Mykonos. But he denies the crime and is appealing against the verdict, and the alleged “do you know who I am?” behaviour is no longer typical. On the contrary, the squad is better known for those of its members, such as Marcus Rashford, who have campaigned for the provision of free school meals and on other issues, or Raheem Sterling, who was honoured by the queen for his stand against racism.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This team is young—the second-youngest of the 24 in the tournament—and it looks like England. In 1966, the year of the team’s solitary big-tournament win, of the World Cup, the team was all-white. This one is racially mixed, and, according to one estimate, the 26-man squad had 13 members whose mixed heritage would have allowed them to choose to represent another country. The team’s media managers successfully conveyed an image of them as wholesome, united and preternaturally calm among the mounting hysteria. An image of the team frolicking on inflatable unicorns in a swimming-pool was such a hit when tried during the World Cup in Russia in 2018 that it was tried again from their camp in Staffordshire. The manager, Gareth Southgate, often likened to a schoolmaster, was calm, and courteous, and became a national symbol of decency, of being a good bloke.</p><p class="article__body-text">Of course, none of this would have mattered if his team had not also been winning. For England fans old enough to remember victory in 1966, following the team since has been a lesson in the famous John Cleese line, that it’s not the despair they can’t stand, it’s the hope. Time and again they have convinced themselves that they have a world-beating team, only to find out that its real genius lay in finding creative ways of losing. Sometimes this could be blamed on perfidious foreigners, as when Diego Maradona, an Argentine genius, scored a goal with his hand in 1986. More often it would be through their own ineptitude: a goalkeeper’s mistake against West Germany in 1970; a succession of missed penalties, typically also against Germany (including one in 1996 by Mr Southgate himself, when he was a player); or just a dreadful team performance, with the nadir perhaps reached in the Euros in 2016, when the team contrived to lose to Iceland, a country with a population of 330,000 and a team including some part-time footballers.</p><p class="article__body-text">So there was much to celebrate in the national coming-together around a decent football team made up of decent people and led by a decent manager. But there is also much to worry about. The cheerful patriotism easily degenerates into ugly atavistic xenophobia, ranging from the rude—the booing of Italy’s national anthem at the final—to <a href="./a-night-to-forget-the-english-fans-that-embarrass-their-country.html">the mindlessly violent</a>, to the vicious online racism. Football can become another battlefield in the culture wars. Indeed, by criticising the England team for taking a knee before games to express opposition to racism, politicians from the ruling Conservative Party had already tried to turn it into just that.</p><p class="article__body-text">The vote for Brexit in 2016, just four days before the defeat to Iceland, revealed divisions in the country that persist. And it exacerbated another tension: that between England and the other constituent nations of <a href="./from-united-kingdom-to-untied-kingdom.html">the United Kingdom</a>. In 1966 World Cup victory was celebrated with the union flag. Nowadays many in Scotland and Wales would find it bizarre to suggest the England team represents them. And for the English, football is an obvious vehicle for a nationalism of their own. Sport, as George Orwell noted in 1945, is an unfailing cause of ill-will. For a brief moment, this tournament seemed different. Amid the tearjerking match reports, newspaper editorials tried to cling to the idea that it had brought the country together—even as the cracks began to reappear—and to hold out hopes for next year’s World Cup in Qatar, when England’s young team will once again embody their country’s dreams of glory.</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=England%20loses%20a%20football%20match%3B%20a%20nation%20mourns&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-12&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fu8pg5gcb0ea5lf7tlaovmft3u58tsijs&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
