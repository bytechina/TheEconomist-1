But in 2018 Westminster Council rejected an application to put one (pictured as a clay sculpture) by Douglas Jennings, who specialises in public art, in Parliament Square, in the heart of London. The site was already crowded with monuments, it ruled, and Thatcher had been depicted in formal robes that she rarely wore.</p><p class="article__body-text">Moreover, the council fretted, it was likely to become a target. Though its plinth would be 4m high and contain sockets to allow protective scaffolding to be erected in a hurry, police worried that it would draw vandals. They recommended security lighting and cameras.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">One year later Grantham, the town where Thatcher grew up, announced that it would take the statue, which is almost twice life-size. The council reasoned that it would draw the right sort of visitors—the far-left activists who might be tempted to attack it being thin on the ground in Lincolnshire. A plinth was duly constructed. But other problems emerged.</p><p class="article__body-text">A plan to spend public money on an unveiling ceremony drew opposition and was nixed; covid-19 prevented public gatherings; protected trees needed trimming so security cameras could overlook the statue. Six years after it was cast, it remains in hiding.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Hot heads, cold feet"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20sorry%20tale%20of%20Margaret%20Thatcher%E2%80%99s%20statue&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-08&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fi4aplc5tq27h3ruo7eq0bg2hmgkr7b22&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
