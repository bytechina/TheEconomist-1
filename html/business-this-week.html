Mr Gensler wants federal securities laws to apply to digital currencies and more powers for the <small>SEC</small> to oversee the market. If not, he worries that “a lot of people will be hurt” by bad investments.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another challenge to traditional banking is emerging from “buy now, pay later” (<small>BNPL</small>), which enables shoppers to spread their payments for goods, sometimes with no interest or credit check but a fee for late instalments. Square, a payments firm run by Jack Dorsey, has offered to buy <strong>Afterpay</strong>, based in Melbourne and a global pioneer in <small>BNPL</small>, for $29bn, Australia’s biggest-ever takeover. Regulators have expressed concern about <small>BNPL</small>’s lax lending rules. The industry has ballooned during the pandemic. Apple is said to want to enter the market.</p><h2>The meme machine</h2><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Robinhood’s</strong> stock had a rollercoaster ride after the firm floated on the stockmarket.

The frenzied trading pushed the stock up by 85% over the offer price.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>General Motors</strong> reported net income of $2.8bn for the second quarter and raised its profit forecast for the year. The carmaker was boosted by its lending business. <small>GM</small> Financial benefited from accelerated demand for used cars as <a href="./21803287.html">output of new vehicles stalled amid a global dearth of semiconductors</a>. <small>GM</small> kept up production of its bestselling models by diverting chip supplies from its less-popular ones, but warned the shortage could affect future profits.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The proposed $40bn takeover of <strong>Arm</strong>, a chip designer based in Britain, by <a href="./will-nvidias-huge-bet-on-artificial-intelligence-chips-pay-off.html"><strong>Nvidia</strong></a>, America’s most valuable semiconductor manufacturer, was reported to be in trouble.

Germany’s economy expanded by 1.5% and France’s by 0.9%.</p><p class="article__body-text">Big <strong>energy companies</strong> reported bumper quarterly profits, boosted by the higher price of oil, still their main source of income despite the industry’s move to cleaner fuels. ExxonMobil, which recorded a loss in every quarter last year, made a net profit of $4.7bn.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>PepsiCo</strong> agreed to sell a majority stake in its Tropicana and Naked fruit juice brands to a private-equity firm for $3.3bn.

The Chinese internet conglomerate said that the authorities had told gaming companies to live up to their social responsibilities, adding more pressure on tech firms in China as the government confronts the industry’s growing clout. Tencent’s share price fell sharply. A measure of Chinese tech stocks listed in New York, the Golden Dragon index, has had its worst month since the global financial crisis of 2007-09.</p><p class="article__body-text">An early target of China’s regulatory crackdown, <strong>Alibaba</strong>, reported a 34% rise in revenue for the second quarter, year on year. Profit was down, however, as the group spent cash on rejigging its various digital platforms. Like others in the Chinese tech industry Alibaba is also adapting to the government’s new edicts.
