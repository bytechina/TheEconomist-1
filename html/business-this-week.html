The <small>S&amp;P 500</small> dropped by almost 2% in a day and the Nasdaq by almost 5% over two days as America warned that a Russian invasion was imminent. The disquiet spread to European markets, where share prices of airlines, which would see flight schedules disrupted by no-fly conflict zones over eastern Europe, were hit particularly hard. Trading seesawed in reaction to the latest diplomatic moves.</p><p class="article__body-text">Russia’s belligerence also caused a spike in <strong>oil prices</strong>. A barrel of Brent crude hit close to $97 a barrel, the highest in seven years. Energy markets are hypersensitive to any disruption in oil-and-gas flows from Russia. In America the White House said it was open to the idea of suspending the fuel tax on petrol until next year.

The minutes of the Fed’s latest meeting showed it discussing a faster timetable. Goldman Sachs forecast that it will raise rates seven times this year.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Russia’s</strong> central bank increased interest rates for the eighth consecutive time, lifting its key rate from 8.5% to 9.5%. Annual inflation is running at close to 9%. The rouble has weakened as markets weigh the effect of crippling <a href="./a-new-history-of-sanctions-has-unsettling-lessons-for-today.html">sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine</a>. The Bank of Russia says more rate rises are possible over coming months.</p><p class="article__body-text">The lifting of a covid-19 state of emergency in September and resulting surge in consumer spending helped <strong>Japan’s economy</strong> expand by 1.3% in the last three months of 2021 compared with the previous quarter, when it had shrunk by 0.7%. Japanese <small>GDP</small> grew by 1.7% for the whole of 2021. New restrictions, however, came into force at the start of this year with the outbreak of the Omicron variant.</p><p class="article__body-text">Falling food prices, notably for pork, lay behind a drop in <strong>China’s</strong> official consumer-inflation rate to 0.9% in January, year on year. Manufacturing costs also eased. The producer-price index rose by 9.1%. That was down from 10.3% in December, helped by a softening of coal and steel prices.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/634/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220219_WWC340.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220219_WWC340.png" srcset="../image/20220219_WWC340.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Britain’s annual rate of <strong> inflation</strong> hit a new 30-year high, as consumer prices rose by 5.5% in the 12 months to January. Inflation is expected to rise to 7% in April when the regulator’s price cap on energy tariffs increases. As in other countries, household-energy costs are soaring. Electricity bills rose by 19% in the year to January and gas bills by 28%.</p></div><h2>A home from home</h2><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Airbnb</strong> reported record revenues for 2021, as pandemic restrictions eased. Although there were signs of its renters returning to cities, growth was stronger in bookings for overnight stays in non-urban areas. Airbnb’s users are also staying in their rented abodes for longer. Long-term stays of 28 nights or more are the company’s fastest-growing category by trip length, now accounting for a fifth of nights booked. This year has seen a surge of interest in summer travel.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Flutterwave</strong> raised $250m in a round of fundraising, bringing its estimated value to $3bn and making it Africa’s most valuable startup.

Texas is seeking billions of dollars from Meta.</p><h2>Market spirits</h2><p class="article__body-text">India’s securities and exchange regulator fined a former head of the <strong>Mumbai bourse</strong> $400,000 for sharing sensitive information with her guru. The regulator noted that Chitra Ramkrishna’s unnamed yogi lived in the Himalayas, and that she had described him as having “spiritual powers” that did not require “physical co-ordinates and would manifest at will”. That didn’t stop her from allegedly emailing the mystical mountain man about confidential business plans. The regulator said she had been a “puppet in his hands”.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The world this week section of the print edition under the headline "Business this week"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Business%20this%20week&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-19&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F9bb12bdofbf3g3ihbb7pk21659dsj3od&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
