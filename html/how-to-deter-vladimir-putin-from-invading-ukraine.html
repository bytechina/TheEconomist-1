In Vladimir Putin, it is run by a man who splenetically regrets the dissolution of the <small>USSR</small>. Mr Putin particularly resents the way two Slavic states, Ukraine and Belarus, <a data-tegid="is9r0ve7sujifgrqhra65r2chco3hpg8" href="./why-russia-has-never-accepted-ukrainian-independence.html">slipped from Moscow’s control</a>. He has recently reasserted a large degree of influence over Belarus, after its election-rigging despot turned to him for help. And he is massing troops on Ukraine’s border—over 70,000 of them, complete with supply lines, field hospitals and the prospect of reinforcements. American intelligence fears that he could invade Ukraine soon. What can be done to deter him?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Ukraine’s armed forces, though better than they were when Mr Putin first started biting chunks out of their country in 2014, are not nearly strong enough to stop a Russian invasion. Nor is there any chance that <small>NATO</small> countries will intervene militarily to defend Ukraine. They do not, and should not, want a war with a nuclear-armed Russia. However, there are ways to raise the costs to Mr Putin of invading.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some are economic. Joe Biden, America’s president, spoke to Mr Putin on December 7th. Mr Biden says he threatened severe economic sanctions were Russia to attack Ukraine again. (It has already annexed Crimea and helped pro-Russian rebels carve out an enclave in Donbas, in eastern Ukraine.) There is talk of cutting Russia off from <small>SWIFT</small>, an international payments system. This would harm Russia, but it is a <a href="./the-hidden-costs-of-cutting-russia-off-from-swift.html">bad idea</a> as it would disrupt other economies, and start a rush of autocratic regimes to find non-Western alternatives. The same deterrence could be achieved, with less collateral damage, by threatening to blacklist Russian financial institutions individually. Meanwhile, America should present a united front with European allies. For starters, Germany should not approve Nord Stream 2, Russia’s newly built gas pipeline that bypasses Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text">A second means of deterrence is military. Although Russia could easily overrun Ukraine, occupying a country for the long term is a different matter, as America found in Iraq. Ukraine needs to make itself indigestible. The West should supply it with more financial aid and defensive weapons to help it become so. Mr Putin’s actions since 2014 have ensured that the vast majority of Ukrainians, even most of those of Russian ethnicity, would resist Russian control of their country.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">At the same time, Western diplomats should seek ways to de-escalate the looming conflict. This is tricky, because so many of Mr Putin’s demands are neither reasonable nor sincere. He says that <small>NATO</small> poses a threat to Russia. It does not. He makes that claim because a functional, democratic Ukraine on his border discredits his authoritarian system, and because his talk of defending Russia from imaginary external enemies is a good way of drumming up support. In a recent poll, only 4% of Russians said the tensions in eastern Ukraine were Russia’s fault, whereas half blamed America and <small>NATO</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden is right to talk to Mr Putin, and should keep doing so. He should try to find face-saving ways for Mr Putin to back down. Since Mr Putin controls how his actions are portrayed on Russian television, this should not be impossible. Mr Biden could make clear again that Ukraine is not about to join <small>NATO</small>, for example, though he should not give Russia a formal veto.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Putin wants America to get Ukraine to implement his vision of the Minsk accords, a peace deal forced on Ukraine at gunpoint after Russian forces routed Ukrainian ones seven years ago. He hopes to create a federal state in Ukraine, with Russia pulling the strings in the east, controlling part of the border and having a large say over foreign policy. Ukraine has resisted this by ring-fencing Donbas, making no effort to recover its lost territory and forging a unitary, decentralised state that, in effect, excludes it. After many casualties and the displacement of 1.5m people, reintegrating Donbas into Ukraine is now more or less impossible, and many Ukrainians no longer desire it, though they would not say so aloud.</p><p class="article__body-text">There is no clean solution to this mess, so the best strategy is to keep talking, with two provisos. First, the Ukrainian government must be in the room. Mr Putin should not be encouraged to treat it as a puppet of the West, since it is not. Second, the aim should be to make even a minor war unattractive for Mr Putin. He may calculate he has more to gain and less to lose from threatening Ukraine, rather than invading it. But he is adept at finding pretexts for smaller acts of aggression, which he brazenly denies he is committing even as they unfold on the world’s television screens. So long as Mr Putin is in charge, Russia will remain a danger to its neighbours. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "How to deter Vladimir Putin"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=How%20to%20deter%20Vladimir%20Putin%20from%20invading%20Ukraine&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fm2ai4bb2bovhkmf5tc2hacmvuq9gf87m&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
