It has also, in Britain, brought renewed vows to crack down on dodgy Russian money sloshing through its economy. London has long been <a href="./londons-financial-flows-are-polluted-by-laundered-money.html">a playground</a> for oligarchs and other well-heeled Russians. The number flocking to the city climbed after the global financial crisis, as Britain courted foreign capital, for instance by selling residence visas to “investors”. Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, has identified £1.5bn ($2bn) of Russian money in London property, the majority of which is held by shell companies in offshore havens. In the borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea alone, some 6,000 properties are registered in the name of anonymously owned companies; many of these are thought to belong to Russians. As well as owning mansions, oligarchs from the former Soviet Union own British football clubs (Roman Abramovich) and newspapers (Evgeny Lebedev), pay to have university departments named after them (Len Blavatnik), send their children to the swankiest schools, and cosy up to political parties, particularly the Conservatives, with donations. Oligarchs are among the heaviest spenders on British law firms, PR consultants and other reputation-launderers.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Many of the oligarchs who live in London or invest there are wholly legitimate. But British campaigners and lawmakers have been left in no doubt about the strong connection between Russian money and illicit finance. A report by Parliament’s intelligence committee in 2020 concluded that London was a “laundromat” for tainted Russian money. (London is often more like an airing cupboard: where loot ends up after being rinsed elsewhere.) An earlier report in 2018, by MPs on the foreign-affairs committee, found that “despite the strong rhetoric, President Putin and his allies have been able to continue ‘business as usual’ by hiding and laundering their corrupt assets in London” and that this helped the Russian leader “to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually-reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy.” </p><p class="article__body-text">Campaigners call for stronger action. One of them, Bill Browder, a former investor in Russia, argues that the British assets of Putin-connected oligarchs are the Kremlin’s Achilles heel. British governments have long insisted that there is no place in their country for corrupt capital and that financial criminals have—as a favourite ministerial mantra has it—“nowhere to hide”. The first prime minister to show some spine was David Cameron, who went to war on financial secrecy in 2016 and held a global anti-corruption summit. But momentum slowed as politicians became distracted first with Brexit and then with covid-19. </p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcT-byRlKrY?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">Some progress has, to be sure, been made in recent years. “Unexplained wealth orders”, introduced in 2017, allow prosecutors to seize assets if the owner cannot adequately explain the origins of their wealth. But only four orders have been issued, none of them against a figure with close links to Mr Putin or his inner circle. The government made life a bit tougher for oligarchs after <a href="./britain-holds-russia-to-account-over-the-skripal-affair.html">the poisoning</a> of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, in Salisbury in 2018; the most prominent target was Mr Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, who became an Israeli citizen after Britain <a href="./roman-abramovichs-visa-woes-signal-a-shift-in-british-policy-on-russia.html">dragged its feet</a> on renewing his visa.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But action by the British authorities continues to lag far behind their rhetoric. Financial police and prosecutors are woefully <a href="./scams-and-fraud-are-criminally-under-policed-in-britain.html">under-resourced</a>, making threats look empty. Spotlight on Corruption, an NGO, calculates that national-level agencies received just £852m last year to fight economic crime, small beer compared to the “more than £100bn” that the National Crime Agency (NCA) reckons money-laundering costs the economy each year. The NCA reasonably keeps asking for more money. Instead, between 2016 and 2021 its core budget decreased by 4.2% in real terms and the number of money-laundering prosecutions fell by over a third, according to Spotlight on Corruption. Meanwhile, the government is de-prioritising legislation that would make it easier to go after Russian financial ne’er-do-wells. This month saw another delay to an economic-crime bill that would shine more light on foreigners’ use of Britain to launder ill-gotten gains, for instance by introducing a registry of the true (“beneficial”) owners of luxury properties. Even the government’s own anti-corruption tsar is openly miffed by the lack of progress.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./could-ukraines-anti-tank-missiles-hamper-a-russian-invasion.html">Could Ukraine’s anti-tank missiles hamper a Russian invasion?</a><br/><a href="./how-big-is-russias-military-build-up-around-ukraine.html">How big is Russia’s military build-up around Ukraine?</a><br/><a href="./how-apples-privacy-push-cost-meta-10bn.html">How Apple’s privacy push cost Meta $10bn</a></p></div></body></html>
