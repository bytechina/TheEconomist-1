Fences, scaffolding and piles of earth dot the landscape. Workers in hi-vis vests are turning farmers’ fields into suburban developments of a few hundred or a few thousand homes. New roads appear frequently, perplexing any satnav that has not been scrupulously kept up to date.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/britains-new-suburbs-are-peculiar-places.mp3" title="Britain’s new suburbs are peculiar places"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Britain is often said to be building too few houses, but that is not the whole story. Imagine a balloon that is being gripped by a pair of hands. The balloon is steadily inflating as the population grows and the national government nags local authorities to build new homes. Meanwhile the hands, representing planning restrictions and local <small>NIMBY</small>s, try to constrain any expansion. In many places the hands prevail, and little or nothing gets built. But in parts the balloon bulges spectacularly, resulting in many more homes than local people need.</p><p class="article__body-text">Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire is one of the bulges. Between 2011 and 2020 its population swelled by 18% to 207,000, making it one of Britain’s fastest-growing places. Aylesbury is neither beautiful nor a roaring economic success. But it lies just beyond the green belt around London, in which development is restricted, so it gets some of the suburban homes that might otherwise be bolted onto the capital. It is England’s frontier, or its Texas—a place where the country is being created at high speed.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It bears little resemblance to the suburbs that Britain built in the 20th century. Developments used to be consistent in form and colour—red-brick rashes, as the poet John Betjeman dismissively described them. The ones going up around Aylesbury are erratic by design. A short stretch of road might contain three-, four- and five-bedroom houses plus a few flats. Some homes are faced with brick, while others have been painted green or finished with cream-coloured render. Roofs have different-coloured tiles and are pitched at various angles. Nothing lines up perfectly. Local planners favour this sort of ersatz villagery, and so do developers, who like a mix of properties to sell.</p><p class="article__body-text">Despite a railway line, an abundance of pavements and some appealing paths around the edges of the suburbs, cars dominate. Every household seems to have at least two. Local sales agents say that couples moving out from London tend to arrive with one but quickly succumb and acquire a second. But the new suburbs seem more embarrassed by their car dependency than older ones did. The local authority insists that vehicles are tucked beside homes or in courtyards behind them, rather than lining the streets. Roads curve and twist in an attempt to slow drivers down.</p><p class="article__body-text">The new suburban developments are dense. A large one known as Kingsbrook constructed by Barratt Homes, Britain’s biggest home builder, fits 33 properties into a hectare (13 per acre). With so much land given over to car parking and garages, little is left for gardens. In “Metroland”, Julian Barnes’s novel of suburbia, published in 1980, the protagonist lies in bed listening to the sound of lawnmowers. The new suburbanites often find that their small, shady yards cannot support lawns. “We turfed the garden three times and it died every time,” says Anna, who lives in a development called Buckingham Park. Like others around her, she gave up and laid Astroturf.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The frontiersmen and women of Aylesbury Vale settled there in the social-media era, and they often gather online, on thriving community Facebook pages. “That’s the way you connect immediately. That’s where you ask what the school is like and how to find a plumber,” says James Talbot, a vicar. Though mostly middle-class, they are a striking mix of white, south Asian and black African. Muslims gather for Ramadan, Hindus for Diwali and cultural Christians for carol-singing. But when these events are over everyone returns to streets and schools that are thoroughly integrated. The developments have no history of racial segregation and no purpose-built churches, mosques or ethnic food shops that might encourage ethnic or religious groups to form clusters.</p><p class="article__body-text">In any case, most residents belong to the same cult of child-worship. Two kinds of people move to the outskirts of Aylesbury: those with children and those who are about to have them. The developments are child-oriented even by suburban standards. They are arranged around schools and playgrounds, with just a few shops and other businesses added, almost as an afterthought. More than anything, they resemble national nurseries.</p><p class="article__body-text">British cities grew in the 19th and 20th centuries by accretion, as new suburbs were built next to older ones. By contrast, the latest developments are islands. Fast roads and high acoustic fences separate them from the rest of Aylesbury. Established residents tend to prefer that large new developments remain at a respectful distance, says Adam Tillion of Barratt Homes. As a result, Aylesbury Vale as a whole is a mess. Though the estates are well-planned individually, they do not add up to a coherent town.</p><h2>Out of sight, out of mind</h2><p class="article__body-text">Nobody loves the new suburbs—apart, that is, from the people who live in them. Rob Butler, Aylesbury’s Conservative <small>MP</small>, says that voters complain about growing pressure on roads and doctors’ surgeries. His constituency is next to Chesham and Amersham, which the Conservatives lost in June to a Liberal Democrat candidate running a <small>NIMBY</small> campaign. Boris Johnson’s government attends to ailing post-industrial towns in the north and Midlands while ignoring fast-growing suburbs in the south-east.</p><p class="article__body-text">It seems an unfortunate oversight. Aylesbury Vale is sprawling and disconnected—a clump rather than a city. But in its ambivalence about cars, its digital enthusiasm, its ethnic complexity and its almost complete lack of high-street shops or formal religious institutions, it points forward. Like it or not, it is a guide to the country Britain is becoming. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics:</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="./jordan-peterson-and-the-lobster.html"><em>Jordan Peterson and the lobster</em></a> (Dec 4th)<strong><br/></strong><em><em><a data-analytics="in_body:link_1:para_12" href="./boris-johnson-should-pick-fights-with-conservative-institutions.html">Boris Johnson should pick fights with conservative institutions</a> (Nov 27th)</em><br/><em><a data-analytics="in_body:link_2:para_12" href="./britains-establishment-has-split-into-two-each-convinced-it-is-the-underdog.html">Britain’s establishment has split into two, each convinced it is the underdog</a> (Nov 20th)</em></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "On the frontier"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%E2%80%99s%20new%20suburbs%20are%20peculiar%20places&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fd4lj60hjijrapi5vsk0u5m51c95mo6f7&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
