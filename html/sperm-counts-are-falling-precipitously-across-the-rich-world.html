It is later revealed that the Soviets did not attack first. Instead the commander, who had a mental breakdown, ordered the strike because he had become convinced that communists had fluoridated America’s water supply in an effort to damage the “precious bodily fluids” of America’s men.</p><p class="article__body-text">The paranoid commander’s fears about his fertility were easy to mock in 1964, when Kubrick’s film was first released. But the premise may be getting closer to reality with each passing day. In 2017, Shanna Swan of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and Hagai Levine of Hadassah-Hebrew University in Jerusalem, along with six other researchers, estimated the average sperm count for 43,000 men in 55 countries across the world. The data, from 185 previously published studies, suggest that sperm counts fell by about 25% between 1973 and 2011 (see chart). But the academics performed a regression analysis that controlled for variation in the studies' sampling technique, their potential sample bias, the age of men and their level of abstinence before a sample was taken. They found that sperm counts had in fact fallen by about 50% in Western countries over the period. Although the data were less plentiful, similar trends were observed in developing countries, too.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Dr Swan's new book, “Count Down”, released earlier this year, investigates why this decline has occurred. The most likely culprit, she argues, is the proliferation of harmful chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA)—which is most commonly found in household plastic goods. Humans’ endocrine systems, which produce hormones including testosterone and oestrogen, can be adversely affected by these chemicals. In some cases they reduce fertility among both men and women. One study, conducted in Boston, looked at nearly 500 young men who hoped to donate sperm. It found that the share of applicants who were sufficiently fertile to donate had fallen from 69% to 44% in the ten years to 2013.</p><p class="article__body-text">BPA chemicals may not be solely to blame. Another study, published by <em>Environmental Pollution</em> in 2018, collected the semen samples of 5,000 men living in northern Italy between 2010 and 2016. By geocoding the men’s home addresses it found that sperm counts deteriorated most when air pollution was highest.</p><p class="article__body-text">Even if BPA chemicals are not the sole cause of the decline in sperm counts, regulators have been slow to catch on to the proven harm they cause. In 2007 the European Union implemented REACH, a set of regulations on the import and production of hazardous chemicals. America and the EU have since banned the use of BPA in baby bottles but the chemical is still allowed in the linings of food cans. The decline in sperm counts, were it to deteriorate further, could have dire consequences. Alarmingly, if the rich-world trend observed by Dr Swan in her 2017 study continued until 2045, it might render half the men of Europe and North America infertile. That looks unlikely for two reasons. The effect of BPAs on sperm may diminish as their counts decline; and already fewer BPA chemicals are being used.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i><b>Correction (December 28th 2021):</b> The penultimate sentence of this article originally used the word "impotent" rather than "infertile".
