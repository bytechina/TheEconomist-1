The protesters who have converged on Ottawa, Canada’s capital, to demand the end of covid-19 restrictions are brandishing it like stars-and-stripes-waving Americans. On weekdays their numbers dwindle to a thousand or so, though the clog of vehicles, from camper vans to 18-wheelers, parked outside parliament makes the crowd seem bigger. On weekends they are joined by many more, often groups of neighbours who form small convoys and bring their children. That’s when bouncy castles go up and dance parties appear. At the slightest excuse people burst into “O Canada”.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21807705.mp3" title="Trudeau invokes emergency powers to shut down Canada’s protests"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Some spout conspiracy theories and wave “Fuck Trudeau” signs, showing their contempt for the Liberal prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Early in the protests some demonstrators waved swastika images. At least one Confederate flag was seen. Other protesters, using tropes beloved by anti-vaxxers worldwide, have absurdly likened Mr Trudeau to a Nazi, and some prominent participants have links to far-right groups.</p><p class="article__body-text">But there is more talk of love, freedom and unity. Éric Fontaine, a boat painter, has been coming every weekend with friends from a small town south of Montreal. “We are against discrimination—every kind of discrimination, including against people who don’t want to get vaccinated,” he says. William Ameni, a Congolese-Canadian, hands out food and Bibles with other members of his church. He was surprised to learn that some of the protesters were anti-immigrant. “As a minority personally I do not feel any hostility,” he says.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Now in its third week, the “freedom convoy”, which began as a protest against vaccine mandates for lorry-drivers entering from the United States, seems to be mellowing. But the government is toughening its response. On February 14th Mr Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in the law’s 34-year history. It gives the federal government powers to override other laws, seize authority from provincial and local governments and freeze the bank accounts of protesters without a court order. The day before, after Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, had declared a state of emergency, police cleared a blockade of the bridge linking Windsor, Ontario with Detroit, the conduit for a quarter of the goods trade between Canada and the United States.</p><p class="article__body-text">After news broke of Mr Trudeau’s plan to crack down, the truckers seemed unfazed. “We will hold the line,” said Tamara Lich, a fundraiser and convoy spokeswoman, on the afternoon of February 14th. The next day Ottawa’s chief of police resigned.</p><p class="article__body-text">Whatever the future holds for the freedom convoy, it has already shaken Canada and rallied populists of the right in other countries. Donald Trump and Fox News anchors have exalted the protesters. Organisers have raised millions of dollars, a large proportion of it from American donors. Copy-cat convoys have been staged in France and Australia.</p><h2>The city is theirs, for now</h2><p class="article__body-text">Canada once seemed immune to the raucous populism that in 2016 gave the world Mr Trump and Brexit. Now it seems to have become a superspreader. More than half of Canadians regard the convoy as a “fundamental attack” on democracy, according to Ipsos, a pollster.</p><p class="article__body-text">Although Canada’s strict public-health policies triggered the protest, its origins lie in older grievances. They are most potent in Canada’s western provinces, which have long felt alienated from the more populous and liberal centre. France’s <em>gilets jaunes</em> (yellow-vest) protests in 2018 against high energy prices inspired a western Canadian movement in favour of oil pipelines and hostile to immigration. That gave rise to “united we roll”, a lorry-led protest in 2019 against Mr Trudeau’s environmental policies, which hurt Alberta’s energy-based economy. The freedom convoy started out as its pandemic-themed successor. Ms Lich, who is described in the Canadian press as “the spark that lit the fire”, was an activist for a party that advocates western Canadian secession as a last resort.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Tom Quiggin, who says he provides “protective intelligence” for the convoy, is the author of an anti-globalist novel called “The New Order of Fear”. According to a tweet he posted, it depicts Mr Trudeau as “dead in his bed, strangled with a pair of halal socks”. Canada Unity, the closest the convoy has to a presiding organisation, initially called for the replacement of the government by a committee that would revoke the vaccine mandate. It has since withdrawn the demand.</p><p class="article__body-text">Stephanie Carvin at Carleton University in Ottawa believes the convoy is “an extremist movement at its heart”. Nearly 60% of Canadians think it consists mainly of “anti-vaxxers and bigots intent on causing mayhem”, according to Ipsos.</p><h2>Hold on, they are not going home</h2><p class="article__body-text">But, like the Omicron variant, it may be mutating into a milder and perhaps more spreadable form. Canada Unity now “condemns all hate symbols” and calls on Canadians to “forget about their differences”. That may widen the protest’s appeal among the majority who now want covid restrictions to end. Despite their scepticism of the freedom convoy, 46% of Canadians think the protesters’ “frustration is legitimate and worthy of our sympathy”. That rises to 61% among 18- to 34-year-olds, and to 59% among those who vote for the Conservatives, the main opposition party.</p><p class="article__body-text">That raises the fear that the convoy could act as a Trojan horse for the sort of Trumpian populism that polarises politics across the border. Richard Johnston, a political scientist, argues that, as in the United States, Canada’s divides have been widening since the 1980s. People who identify with the Conservatives look a lot like Republicans; supporters of Mr Trudeau’s Liberals resemble American Democrats. In opinion surveys, “it’s very hard to see the border,” says Mr Johnston.</p><p class="article__body-text">When Mr Trudeau was first elected in 2015 he wanted to forestall a backlash against globalisation and immigration, then already occurring in other countries, by boosting the middle class “and those working hard to join it”. He had some success, especially in his first term. His government introduced a means-tested child benefit that reduced poverty and cut tax rates on the bottom of the income scale while raising them for the rich. Under Mr Trudeau Canada managed the pandemic better than many countries (thanks partly to provincial premiers, who make most of the public-health rules in their territories). Confirmed deaths from covid-19 are about a third of those in the United States, in proportion to population.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220219_amc314.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220219_amc314.png" srcset="../image/20220219_amc314.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Yet many Canadians do not see Mr Trudeau as a healer (see chart). In 2018 his government set a national floor for the price of carbon and banned oil tankers from loading on part of the west coast, especially enraging oil-dependent Albertans. It has raised immigration targets from around 270,000 in 2015 to 411,000 this year, more than 1% of the population (in part to make up for a pandemic drop).</p><p class="article__body-text">In his second term Mr Trudeau became more interested in identity than income, making protection of indigenous and gay people and other minorities his signature theme. He seems to agree with leftists who think that causing offence is a greater crime than suppressing speech.</p><p class="article__body-text">The censoriously illiberal left has made inroads into several Canadian institutions. Rima Azar, a tenured professor of psychology at Mount Allison University, was suspended last year for seven months after writing a blog post in which she argued that Canada was “not racist” and that Black Lives Matter was a “radical” organisation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Trudeau’s government has expressed shock that racist symbols were displayed during the protest. It appears to be planning to reintroduce an “anti-hate” bill that could lead to the imprisonment of people who use racist speech. This could include a clause which would allow individuals to take other people to court if they fear that they may be about to say something which falls under the definition of “hate propaganda”. They could also be charged for contemplating an offence “motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other similar factor”. Lovers of free speech are aghast at the potential scope of this law.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The pandemic has brought the sort of populist insurgency Mr Trudeau had hoped to forestall. Whether it moves beyond causing chaos to threatening institutions depends in part on how Canada’s politicians react. For the Conservative Party the freedom convoy is both a threat and a temptation. The protesters “deserve respect”, declared Candice Bergen, the party’s interim leader, who has sported a “Make America Great Again” cap. Pierre Poilievre, the only declared candidate so far in the forthcoming party-leadership election, has said that the convoy represents “all those that our government and our media have insulted and left behind”, a line that Mr Trump could have uttered.</p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220219_amp002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220219_amp002.jpg" srcset="../image/20220219_amp002.jpg"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The Conservatives are glancing nervously over their right shoulders at Maxime Bernier, a former Conservative minister who has been handing out “freedom pancakes” to the protesters. His People’s Party of Canada, formed in 2018, advocates lower immigration and denies that climate change is dangerous. Although it won no seats in last year’s election it took nearly 5% of the vote, and tripled its vote share.</p><p class="article__body-text">But Canada’s immunity to Trumpism and its mutations has not collapsed. Protectionism and immigrant-bashing, Mr Trump’s most distinctive causes, cannot win elections in Canada. Trade is the equivalent of 60% of Canada’s <small>GDP</small> compared with 23% in the United States. Elections are won and lost in greater Toronto and Vancouver’s suburbs, which have racially diverse populations. The Conservatives’ post-mortem on their loss last year in part blamed the party’s earlier resort to tactics like barring new Canadians from wearing niqabs when taking the citizenship oath, which offended Muslims. “That doesn’t mean there isn’t a backlash” against immigrants, says Mr Johnston. “It’s lurking in the Conservative grassroots.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Those grassroots are more influential than they used to be, but have not yet seized control. Unlike in the United States, regional parties are not subsidiaries of national ones. Mr Ford is aligned with the national Conservatives but he belongs to the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. The federal Conservatives cannot control regional legislatures as America’s politicians do. Independent commissions draw the boundaries of electoral districts, avoiding the gerrymandering that contributes to polarisation in the United States. The share of fundamentalist Christians in the electorate is much smaller, which gives politicians less scope to mobilise voters passionately opposed to social change.</p><p class="article__body-text">Few Canadians wish their politics were more like those of their southern neighbour. Two-thirds say their system of government is better, according to the Confederation of Tomorrow, an annual survey. Just 5% say the United States has a better system. In 1991 preferences were almost evenly divided.</p><p class="article__body-text">The culprit for this immense shift in assessments of the two systems, the survey says, is America’s increasingly polarised politics, culminating in Mr Trump’s presidency. Mr Trump’s endorsement of the convoy may therefore encourage Canadians to reject the sort of politics it represents. The anti-vaxx uprising is “a spasm”, Mr Johnston thinks. “It’s unsettling, it’s embarrassing, but it’s not existential.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our <a href="./page-not-found.html">coronavirus hub</a>.
