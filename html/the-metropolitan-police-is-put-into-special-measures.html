The Met has been buffeted by scandal after scandal, most shockingly the murder in 2021 of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer. It has lacked a permanent commissioner since Dame Cressida Dick was forced to step down in April. On June 28th it emerged that Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services, a policing watchdog, had put Britain’s largest police force into special measures. That means the Met is now subject to heightened scrutiny and must produce a remedial plan to tackle a litany of failings. Underlying this downward spiral is a steady loss of confidence in the force, among Londoners as a whole and among victims of crime (see charts). Whoever is chosen, the new commissioner has a very big job ahead of them. </p></div></body></html>
