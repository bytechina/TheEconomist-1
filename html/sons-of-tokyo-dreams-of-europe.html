It carried the new mistress of the castle, a young Japanese woman trained as a geisha who, by virtue of her marriage one year earlier to a progressive Austro-Hungarian diplomat, had become Countess Mitsuko von Coudenhove-Kalergi. Her husband Heinrich had accompanied her on the long voyage by steamboat and train, having given up his post in Tokyo to come home and raise his sons. They had arrived in Ronsperg earlier, sent ahead with their nursemaids and Heinrich’s faithful Armenian manservant, Babik. The elder boy, two-year-old Hansi, would eventually inherit the castle and be jailed for co-operating with the Nazis. The younger, 18-month-old Richard, would become a father of the European Union.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/sons-of-tokyo-dreams-of-europe.mp3" title="Sons of Tokyo, dreams of Europe"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Ronsperg is recorded in 14th-century documents as a Czech village, Pobezovice, but by the 1890s it was German-speaking, with a Yiddish-speaking Jewish minority. The carriage rode uphill past the synagogue and the church to the castle, a Gothic fortress remodelled during the 17th century into a Baroque chateau. Mounting the steps Mitsuko looked out over orchards and farms to the hills on the Bavarian border, with the family hunting lodge hidden in the trees.</p><p class="article__body-text">It would prove a difficult home for Mitsuko. She initially spoke limited German and suspected the locals were mocking her. But for Richard, childhood in Ronsperg was “paradise”, he later wrote. He lost himself in the library of his father, who was studying philosophy and writing articles denouncing anti-Semitism and duelling. The castle swarmed with exotic guests: Japanese diplomats, Jesuits, a rabbi and a Muslim scholar. Coudenhove-Kalergi credited Ronsperg with forming his worldview. Alongside his studies at Vienna’s Theresianum, the school of the Austro-Hungarian ruling class, it taught him that “nationalism was not a problem of blood or race but of education”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Few Europeans remember Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi. But as Martyn Bond argues in a new biography, he deserves as much credit as anyone for creating the <small>EU</small>. In 1923 he wrote a bestselling book, “Pan-Europa”, advocating a United States of Europe. He launched a movement, the Paneuropean Union, which soon had thousands of members, including Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann. Adolf Hitler referred to him as “that cosmopolitan bastard”. He was probably the model for Victor Laszlo, the activist fleeing the Nazis in “Casablanca”. He counselled Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle on creating a European federation, and proposed Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” as its anthem.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet today his name is best known on the paranoid right. Over the past decade and a half, xenophobic nationalist groups all across Europe have put him at the centre of their conspiracy theories. Seizing on predictions he made of rising migration and intermarriage, they have imagined a secret “Kalergi plan” comprising the <small>EU</small>’s real mission: to destroy European nations through miscegenation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ask anti-immigrant militia leaders in Bulgaria why refugees are crossing from Turkey, and you will hear it is part of the Kalergi plan. Candidates standing for the For Britain Movement, an insignificant political party, fulminate about the Kalergi plan for white genocide. In Italy the Kalergi plan is a hobby horse of neo-fascist groups. And in the Czech Republic, where Ronsperg is known again as Pobezovice, the most important far-right politician frowns at Coudenhove-Kalergi’s name. He represents “exactly what we don’t want,” says the head of the nationalist <small>SPD</small> party, Tomio Okamura.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Okamura is the son of a Japanese father and a Czech mother. His parents married in communist Czechoslovakia; he was born in Tokyo in 1972. He came to Prague as a child, when his mother returned with her three sons after the marriage failed. His move from Japan was tougher than Coudenhove-Kalergi’s: his depressed mother was sent to a psychiatric clinic. An aunt took in the oldest boy, but Tomio and his younger brother spent a miserable year or so in an orphanage.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Okamura came to attention as a guest on television shows in the 2000s, having built a successful travel business focused on Asian tourists. He was a peppy salesman for Czech culture, making light of his background by calling himself “the only slant-eyed Moravian”. In 2010 he published a bestselling autobiography, “Tomio Okamura: the Czech Dream”. He launched his first party three years later.</p><p class="article__body-text">Initially Mr Okamura ran denouncing corruption and advocating referendums, but he soon shifted to bashing Islam and the <small>EU</small>. He is best known abroad for claiming refugees will introduce “monkey plague” to Europe and calling for a referendum on Czexit. In the latest election, in October, the <small>SPD</small> won 10% of the vote, a bit below its share in 2017.</p><p class="article__body-text">Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi and Tomio Okamura make for curious bookends to Europe’s past century. Coudenhove-Kalergi’s detractors asked what business a half-Japanese interloper had telling European nations to unite. Mr Okamura’s critics wonder how he manages to square his xenophobia with his background. How did they end up on opposite sides of the European question? Was it character? Or has the direction of history changed?</p><h2>The aristocrat</h2><p class="article__body-text">In “Pan-Europa”, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that unless Europe chose political and economic union, it would slide, again, into war and end up ruled by America and Russia. These were inhuman societies, one commercial, the other military. As the home of civilisation and freedom, Europe had to unite and merge its colonial empires to seize back its role in history.</p><p class="article__body-text">The notion of a European federation had existed since the 18th century, and Coudenhove-Kalergi’s version would largely appeal to today’s Europhiles. But they would not approve of his ambivalence towards democracy. He believed in an aristocracy of education and talent, and associated universal suffrage with nationalism. In one essay he proposed that politics be organised by profession and class rather than simple democracy. He was intrigued by Benito Mussolini, Italy’s dictator who had entertained similar ideas, and sought to enlist him in his movement.</p><p class="article__body-text">In his 1925 book “Practical Idealism” Coudenhove-Kalergi’s interest in aristocracy spilled over into the language of race, including the lines underlying the “Kalergi plan” myth. Due to migration, he wrote, “today’s races and castes will gradually disappear,” becoming “the Eurasian-Negroid race of the future”. The Jews would furnish the “leaders of humanity”.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“Vienna was full of people thinking about a new world order, in every café”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">The passages praising Jews are significant. In 1915, at 20, he had married Ida Roland, a famous Jewish actress 13 years his senior. (He first saw her playing Catherine the Great.) It was a happy marriage, though Mitsuko disapproved. Ida subsidised Richard’s lifestyle: driving around Europe in a chauffeured Bentley, staying in grand hotels while recruiting for his movement.</p><p class="article__body-text">He also got money from Max Warburg, the powerful German banker. Coudenhove-Kalergi’s theory of politics was aristocratic: Europe could be unified by cultivating leaders and elites. He was quietly encouraged by Tomas Masaryk, the first president of independent Czechoslovakia, and openly supported by Aristide Briand, prime minister of France. Churchill was interested too. At the beginning of the 1930s it seemed the project might work.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">By the late 1930s it was clear it would not. The Nazis crushed the German chapters of the Paneuropean Union. In 1938 Coudenhove-Kalergi was running his movement from Vienna. He and Ida were hosting a dinner party when news arrived of the Anschluss. He was on a Gestapo hit list. They hopped into the Bentley and rode to Zagreb, alerting the Italian government that they planned to cross to Switzerland. Coudenhove-Kalergi’s cultivation of Mussolini paid off: he sent an honour guard to escort them.</p><p class="article__body-text">When France fell they jumped in the Bentley again, rode to Lisbon and got seats on the fully booked seaplane to New York, apparently via sympathisers in the American government. (The claim that this was the origin of the Victor Laszlo plotline in the film “Casablanca” is circumstantial but persuasive. Among other things, Paul Henreid, who played Laszlo, was a fellow graduate of the Theresianum.) Friends landed Coudenhove-Kalergi a professorship at New York University while he sought to persuade President Franklin Roosevelt to back European unification. He failed, in part because his anti-communism was inconvenient at a time when the Soviet Union was an ally. But the war convinced him of democracy’s virtues. In its aftermath a European Union seemed no more Utopian than the other new international organisations.</p><p class="article__body-text">After the war Coudenhove-Kalergi had to get his older brother out of jail. Hansi had turned rather strange, stuffing Ronsperg with kitschy portraits of his Coudenhove ancestors. He liked to travel with a mummy that he had bought in Egypt. The Czechs charged him with consorting with Nazi officers—he was probably protecting his wife, who, like Ida, was Jewish. Meanwhile, Coudenhove-Kalergi worked his contacts with Churchill, who was pushing for a United States of Europe, and with de Gaulle.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“Lots of cranks with ideas about the future were mixing”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">But by now other players were on the scene. A rival British-backed group, the United European Movement , did most of the planning for the Congress of Europe in 1948, which led to the Council of Europe, an inter-parliamentary body. Two years later Jean Monnet, a French businessman and civil servant, laid the foundation of the <small>EU</small> by helping negotiate the European Coal and Steel Community. Monnet apparently saw Coudenhove-Kalergi as a useless idealist. In the 1950s and 1960s he found himself gradually sidelined. He left little institutional legacy when he died in 1972.</p><p class="article__body-text">Coudenhove-Kalergi himself seems to have worried he was too much of a dreamer. In “Practical Idealism” he writes that people of mixed race can see things from many sides, but the more they do so, “the weaker usually is their will to act”. The “heroic, single-minded man” must set aside diverse perspectives to achieve great things. This makes his quest for European unity seem an effort to resolve anxieties over his identity, much like Hansi’s ancestor portraits.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet Barbara Coudenhove-Kalergi, Richard’s niece, thinks it is simpler: “He was a child of the multinational Habsburg empire.” Barbara is the daughter of the third brother, Gerolf, who worked for Japan’s embassy in Prague. In Barbara’s telling, the brothers’ identity crisis was not so much about being half-Japanese as being fully Austro-Hungarian. After the war her family was kicked out of Czechoslovakia along with 3m other German-speakers as collective punishment for Nazi misdeeds. But her father said the expulsion was nothing compared to seeing his homeland dissolve in 1918.</p><p class="article__body-text">As for Richard’s dreams, “you have to remember that when he was young Vienna was full of people thinking about a new world order, in every café,” Barbara explains. Trotsky, Stalin and Hitler all lived there in 1913. “Lots of cranks with ideas about the future were mixing, and Dicky was one of them.”</p><h2>The striver</h2><p class="article__body-text">On a sunny day in September 2021, Tomio Okamura stood in a town square 100km south of Prague, warning several hundred voters about his liberal opponents: “They want more migrants, they want to introduce the euro, they want to get rid of gender, they want to raise property taxes.” Next to the stage, stalls in the colours of his Freedom and Direct Democracy (<small>SPD</small>) party were selling Czech produce, promoting his plan to make the country self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>SPD</small> resembles other populist parties in Europe, combining right-wing stances on immigrants, gender and the <small>EU</small> with left-wing ones on social welfare and pensions. Mr Okamura banters endlessly with constituents, and like many populists he has good comic timing. (“I’m sorry but we’re born either with or without a wee-wee,” gets a big laugh.) Many Czechs who remember his earlier, jovial <small>TV</small> personality wonder whether his xenophobia is an act.</p><p class="article__body-text">But in an interview after the rally, Mr Okamura evinced genuine antipathy towards the <small>EU</small>. “For us it’s not important what the <small>EU</small> says, some foreigners a thousand kilometres away who never lived together with us in the Czech Republic…speaking in some languages we don’t understand. I’m sorry but I don’t understand English and French,” he said, speaking in English. “Czech citizens [are] the most Eurosceptic nation in the European Union.”</p><p class="article__body-text">This is an exaggeration, but most surveys show Czechs to be among the less enthusiastic <small>EU</small> members. For Mr Okamura, mentioning the economic benefits provokes only resentment. Czechs are not so poor, he says, that we need to be grateful for the <small>EU</small>’s money.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Many Czechs think Mr Okamura’s pugnacity has something to do with his youth. A Czech documentary in 2019, “The Okamura Brothers”, includes a television interview in which Mr Okamura called the orphanage the most intense experience of his childhood. “I was bullied there. From that time I had a stammer until I was about 22,” he says. He realised he would “always [have] to rely solely on myself”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Like the Coudenhove-Kalergi brothers, the Okamura brothers have handled their mixed identities differently. Tomio’s older brother, Hayato, has deferential Japanese manners. He has had a career as a tour guide in Prague, partly through Tomio’s agency. Upset at the effect of Tomio’s politics on the family name, he has repeatedly run for parliament as a Christian Democrat. This year he got in. Asked about Hayato, Tomio cannot resist a dig: he would be happy to offer his brother more work someday. “He is a very good tour guide.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The youngest brother, Osamu, is a successful architect who votes for liberal parties. He and his brothers try to stay out of each others’ politics. But one of Tomio’s statements in April made that difficult for Osamu, who is gay. In parliament Tomio had denounced a bill that would permit same-sex couples to adopt children. “I grew up in an orphanage for part of my childhood,” he had said, “and I can tell you that if a same-sex couple adopted me, I’d rather jump out the window.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Dreams and nightmares are formed in childhood, those of Europe, too. What room in Ronsperg Castle did Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi see when he imagined his united Europe? His father’s library, with its statues of Buddha and Plato? What room does Tomio Okamura see when he thinks of the <small>EU</small>, with its open doors of nationality and sexuality, and its directors lecturing in unfamiliar languages?</p><p class="article__body-text">In Pobezovice today only the medieval centre recalls the Ronsperg that Mitsuko rode into 125 years ago. The Nazis burned down the synagogue and murdered the Jewish inhabitants, and post-war Czechoslovakia expelled the German-speakers. On a rainy day in September it was impossible to find anyone who spoke German, though the border is just 10km away. A few young people spoke halting English. They had never heard of Coudenhove-Kalergi.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ronsperg Castle boasts a visitor’s centre but it is run on a shoestring budget. On the gates of the lower courtyard, marble plaques in Czech and German commemorate Coudenhove-Kalergi as the “father of the idea of European Union”. The palace is crumbling, its windows painted over with fairy-tale characters in a forlorn effort at civic renewal. At the entrance a stone arch bears a legend in Latin: <em>erit hora</em>, “the hour will come”. Some nobleman’s motto, or perhaps one of Hansi’s fakes. Across the street at the EuroOil station a woman understood enough Russian to point the way to the Jewish cemetery. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ILLUSTRATION: ORIANA FENWICK</small></p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/christmas-style-fixes/index.html"></iframe></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Christmas Specials section of the print edition under the headline "Sons of Tokyo, dreams of Europe"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Sons%20of%20Tokyo%2C%20dreams%20of%20Europe&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fd2as53irg59ns5lpfj2u5porek9o9p42&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
