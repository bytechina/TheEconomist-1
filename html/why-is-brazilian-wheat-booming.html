So it is worrying that global production is <a href="./a-world-grain-shortage-puts-tens-of-millions-at-risk.html">expected to fall</a> in 2022 for the first time since 2019. One unlikely country, however, is bucking the trend. In the first quarter of the year Brazil, a net importer of wheat, exported 2.2m tonnes of the stuff, more than four times as in the same period a year earlier. That was despite poor weather conditions in the south of the country (exacerbated by the <a href="./what-is-la-nina.html">La Niña</a> weather pattern), where 90% of Brazil’s wheat is cultivated. Why are Brazilian farmers growing so much? Could they help ease the global supply crunch? </p><p class="article__body-text">The export boom is driven mostly by markets. Last year droughts in North America and Europe wiped out vast swathes of crops. Other calamities followed. When Russia (the world’s biggest wheat exporter) invaded <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">Ukraine</a> (the fifth biggest), Africa and the Middle East struggled to find replacements for Ukrainian wheat. India, the world’s second biggest producer, initially plugged some of that gap—until it was hit by a heatwave. To protect its domestic supply, on May 13th the Indian government banned exports of wheat. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Add in shipping delays arising from covid-19 lockdowns and the growing cost of inputs such as fuel, and the price of wheat has reached record highs: the cereal is now over 60% dearer than it was at the start of the year. Those Brazilian farmers who have been able to pivot from other crops, such as corn or soy—it takes around 120 days to grow and harvest wheat—have done well. And thanks to the weakness of the real, Brazil’s currency, the country’s wheat has become some of the cheapest on global markets. That has made it a tempting proposition for importers. In the first quarter of 2022 Brazilian wheat sales to Arab countries, for example, rose by 438% compared with the same period a year earlier. </p><p class="article__body-text">The rush to grow the golden bushels is also part of a longer-term plan. Fifty years ago Brazil was not known for soybeans; it is now the world’s biggest exporter. For a decade Embrapa, the government agricultural research institute behind that shift, has hoped to do something similar for wheat. Part of the strategy involves moving production north to the tropical savannah of the <i>cerrado</i>. Embrapa says wheat cultivation can expand in the <i>cerrado </i>without the need for deforestation by rotating wheat with other crops, and developing tropical strains. Embrapa has also been encouraging farmers to increase crop yields. The world record for the most bags of wheat per hectare belongs to a Brazilian who uses Embrapa’s techniques, including the sowing of selectively bred wheat strains. </p><p class="article__body-text">Yet Brazil may struggle to maintain its production increase. In the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil’s biggest grain producer, a dearth of big mills to process wheat has slowed farmers down. For the next harvest in September, many southern farmers are sowing corn, which tends to provide more reliable yields at less volatile prices. Rising borrowing costs also make it expensive to buy the equipment needed to switch to wheat. And farmers are hamstrung by high fuel prices and a dependence on imported fertiliser, almost half of which comes from Russia and Belarus, which are under international sanctions. </p><p class="article__body-text">Even the most optimistic analysts reckon that, at the current rate of growth, it will take ten years for Brazil to become a self-sufficient net exporter. It may be one of the world’s great breadbaskets, but when it comes to producing wheat, Brazil is not yet the cream of the crop. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-the-war-in-ukraine-is-driving-up-europes-use-of-coal-and-its-price.html">Why the war in Ukraine is driving up Europe’s use of coal—and its price</a><br/><a href="./what-does-it-take-to-join-nato.html">What does it take to join NATO?</a><br/><a href="./why-the-black-sea-matters-to-russia.html">Why the Black Sea matters to Russia</a></p></div></body></html>
