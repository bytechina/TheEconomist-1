On December 7th, a junior diplomat-turned-whistleblower laid bare the chaos that surrounded the British evacuation of Kabul in evidence to <small>MP</small>s. The prime minister denied the claim that he personally ordered the airlift of pet dogs as eligible Afghans were left behind. The same day a video emerged of Downing Street aides and press officers joking about a Christmas party held in breach of lockdown a year ago; the next day a senior press officer, Allegra Stratton, who was seen laughingly suggesting that the event had been work-related, resigned. The prime minister, implausibly, declared he was shocked and announced an investigation. And all the while, concerns grow about the <a href="https://econ.st/3CqoZTs">Omicron variant </a>of covid-19. Rules on mask-wearing and working from home have been strengthened, though Christmas parties can still go ahead—for now.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21806682.mp3" title="Behind the chaos and scandal of Boris Johnson’s government lies stasis"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Such evidence of arrogance, incompetence and poor judgment would reflect badly on any government. But this one has shrugged off bad press before—including over lockdown breaches, such as a jaunt last year to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot, by Dominic Cummings, then Mr Johnson’s chief aide. Labour, the main opposition party, has failed to open up the clear poll lead required by Britain’s unequal electoral geography for it to form a majority government (see chart). What leaves Mr Johnson’s supporters despairing is less crisis than stasis. On many fronts, the revolution he promised during Brexit negotiations and on the campaign trail in 2019 has stalled. The idea that Johnsonism could be a new model of government, like Thatcherism and Blairism, now looks far-fetched.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The working Tory majority of 87 seats in 2019 was an electoral revolution. It was followed by constitutional revolution, as Britain left the <small>EU</small>. For a “people’s government” of self-styled radicals who quote Gramsci and Lenin, that was only the beginning. A revolution in steel and concrete would “level up” Britain’s economic geography. A cultural revolution would vanquish elites on behalf of blue-collar voters. A march through the institutions would bring the civil service, courts and quangos to heel.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211211_brc153.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211211_brc153.png" srcset="../image/20211211_brc153.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Mr Johnson’s ideological victory is total: only a brave few now advocate rejoining the <small>EU</small> or champion cities over towns. But Brexit has become a frozen conflict. <a href="./to-understand-lord-frost-is-to-understand-britains-approach-to-brexit.html">David Frost</a>, the chief <small>EU</small> negotiator, is seeking to renegotiate the divorce treaty, and the promised new relationship with Europe is nowhere in sight. <small>EU</small> trade deals have been replicated but no big new deals signed. Nor, to Lord Frost’s frustration, has regulation diverged from <small>EU</small> models.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Cummings had started work on new subsidy and procurement rules and a looser immigration regime for scientists, but since his exit in late 2020 policy innovation has ground to a halt. An experimental replacement for <small>EU</small> payments to farmers is still embryonic, even as existing subsidies are withdrawn. Three hefty reforms being pursued by Mr Johnson’s government—an online-safety bill, tougher screening of foreign investment and tighter competition rules—are legacies of his predecessor, Theresa May. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has shied away from structural tax reform.</p><p class="article__body-text">As for levelling up, what started as an aspiration to close the productivity gap between north and south has become a slogan for almost any state activity outside London. A policy paper has been delayed. Ministers disagree on devolution. Having promised an infrastructure boom, last month Mr Johnson cut back <a href="./britains-government-scales-back-plans-to-transform-the-railways.html">ambitious plans for new railways in the north</a>.</p><p class="article__body-text">The government has bashed and battered institutions, but not remade or reformed them. Mr Cummings hankered to break up the civil service, and his tenure saw some senior figures squeezed out. Yet they were replaced by Whitehall lifers, and what remains of the reform programme is consensual and conventional. Ministers have dreamed since the 1960s of relocating civil servants outside London, bringing in more tech skills and improving training, notes Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government, a think-tank. A war on Scottish separatism, led by a combative “Union Unit” in Downing Street, has been wound down, to the relief of Scots Tories who thought it counterproductive. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, lobs insults at <small>BBC</small> bosses but has no serious plan for public-service broadcasting.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Who betrayed the revolution? Covid-19 derailed Mr Johnson’s premiership, occupying tens of thousands of civil servants, burning political capital with <small>MP</small>s and sending borrowing to £320bn in 2020-21 ($424bn, 15.2% of <small>GDP</small>). Little surprise, then, that the Treasury has emerged as a major constraint on Mr Johnson’s aspirations. It has plumped up departmental budgets, but balked at signing cheques for levelling up. Adult social care, a supposed beneficiary of politically costly tax rises, will remain underfunded as the extra cash goes on the pandemic health-care backlog. Bringing net carbon emissions down to zero is Mr Johnson’s most ambitious target, but the Treasury is reluctant to use the tax system to encourage behavioural change.</p><h2>Sounds like a whisper</h2><p class="article__body-text">For true radicals, Conservative voters can look like the enemy within. The next election will be a defensive operation to hold seats won in 2019, which means jettisoning policies that would disrupt the lives of older voters in provincial towns. A liberalisation of planning rules has been parked; loosening food standards, which would allow a more ambitious trade policy, is off-limits. In their place are simplistic responses to complex problems, such as promises of tougher sentencing for child-abusers, and headline-friendly policies such as stricter pet-welfare laws.</p><p class="article__body-text">But the main culprits are in Downing Street, which is as callow as the leaked video of staff sniggering about a cheese-and-wine party suggests. Ministers want Mr Johnson to draft in an old hand to lead its inexperienced staff. Mr Cummings wanted it to be a panopticon, monitoring Whitehall performance from a <small>NASA</small>-style control room. Instead it is kept in the dark by ministers and preoccupied with internal politics. Like any good revolutionary, Mr Johnson believed that intractable problems, such as regional inequality and irregular migration, could be solved by sheer willpower. Caution was scorned as gloomsterism. “Government is boring,” says a colleague, “and for him it is excruciating.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Far from matching Margaret Thatcher in transformation and vision, Mr Johnson is proving less dynamic than David Cameron, his rival at Eton and Oxford. Mr Cameron’s career ended in ignominy after he called, and lost, a referendum on Europe, but he made significant reforms to education, devolution and the civil service. It is neither scandals over cheese-and-wine parties, nor even the risk of electoral defeat, that keeps Tory radicals awake at night. It is the sight of a landslide victory being wasted. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "The revolution stalls"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Behind%20the%20chaos%20and%20scandal%20of%20Boris%20Johnson%E2%80%99s%20government%20lies%20stasis&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-08&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fmvuhdbnqle0ica2gkeefbq0getiq14n6&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
