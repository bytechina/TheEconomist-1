One day this winter a battered sheet of corrugated iron appeared, lodged in the gap as if it had blown in. In reality, the middle-aged brothers who farm nearby are probably responsible: their sheep have a habit of busting into others’ fields. In the chilling wind the sheet quivers, like a living thing.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-rise-and-rise-of-corrugated-iron.mp3" title="The rise and rise of corrugated iron"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Rusted corrugated iron melds with autumn’s russet colours, just as the corrugated roofs of nearby barns sit comfortably in Dartmoor’s weather-worn landscape. For decades, corrugated iron has been used by farmers for lambing sheds, shepherds’ huts, shelter for farm machinery and much more.</p><p class="article__body-text">Too often, corrugated iron (in fact, more usually, steel) goes ignored. Tastemakers have looked down on it, though that is changing. Invented in the early 19th century, its spread represents a revolution that is playing out still, on a global scale. Sheets of corrugated iron marked the first wide-scale building material that did not spring from what lay, in terms of stone, clay and timber, around. It represented the first widespread use of steel in buildings. Corrugated iron is light, and easy to transport and assemble. That enabled the first mass production of prefabricated buildings—introducing the flat-packable concept a century before <small>IKEA</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">From the mid-19th century, some of the biggest waves of human migration and settlement were indivisible from the corrugated iron that people often brought with them. The metal enabled life in places that were otherwise inhospitable because of climate, terrain or paucity of local materials for shelter. It is, write Adam Mornement and Simon Holloway in their terrific book on the stuff, “a material of the frontier”.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Corrugated iron is a child of the Industrial Revolution</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Consider its ubiquity. Water butts, bird hides, outside latrines, aircraft hangars, aircraft themselves, water towers, lighthouses, the abandoned whaling station of Grytviken on South Georgia and, most hauntingly, places of human internment, be they for refugees, prisoners-of-war or the persecuted: corrugated iron has loomed large. In Mawsynram in north-east India, which receives the highest rainfall on Earth, buildings cannot be of wood, for they quickly rot; the sound of the Mawsynram climate, then, is the rat-a-tat-tat of huge raindrops falling on “tin”, as the material is widely referred to. Tennessee Williams knew what metaphor he wanted for the enervated sexuality and jittery frustrations of Maggie, one of his best-known protagonists, in a doomed marriage—“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Corrugated iron is a child of the Industrial Revolution. The best-known origin story starts at the Phoenix ironworks near Birmingham, when a sheet of metal serving as a guard protecting workers making rails worked loose and got pulled into the gears of the machine. While the workers fabricated a new guard, John Spencer, master of the ironworks, picked up the crumpled sheet. It did not flop around or bend under pressure as sheet metal usually did.</p><p class="article__body-text">Spencer had stumbled upon how a linear pattern of ridges and furrows renders a sheet stiffer perpendicular to the axis of the corrugation. The scientific explanation for this lies in the, to laymen, nearly inscrutable <em>Theorema Egregium</em> (Remarkable Theorem) of Carl Friedrich Gauss, published in 1827 and concerning the curvature of surfaces. More intuitively, consider a common pizza-eating strategy: gently bending your slice before bringing it to your mouth obviates the risk of buckling and consequent mess.</p><p class="article__body-text">Spencer envisaged a machine in which sheets were fed through a pair of grooved rollers. Thus was the barrel corrugator born, a thundering machine that served as the chief way to make corrugated iron until the second world war. But the earliest patent was registered in 1829 by Henry Palmer, an architect and engineer with the London Dock Company. Palmer's insight was that while possessing transverse strength, corrugated sheets can still be curved lengthways and then lapped and riveted to form a self-supporting arch. Such a roof would be light. But in the same way that the shell of an egg represents impressive structural strength, it would be capable of bearing compressive forces present in all roofs as their weight bears down with gravity on whatever is holding them up. Up to a certain span a corrugated roof of self-supporting sheets can arch across a given space with little or no recourse to the usual supports used to hold up roofs clad in slate or other heavy materials. Suddenly, sheds far larger than had previously existed became imaginable.</p><h2>The world’s entrepot</h2><p class="article__body-text">Towards the end of the 18th century, London was the victim of its own success. The River Thames was choked with vessels from around the world waiting for a limited number of wharves. Work on a new London Dock began in 1800. But by the time the 32-year-old Palmer was hired in 1827, the London Dock was bursting. A new basin, locks and warehousing were needed. Palmer would oversee the work.</p><p class="article__body-text">In 1829 he proposed a large and new type of structure, the 2,200 square-foot (204 square-metre) Turpentine Shed. It was the world’s first corrugated-iron building. Its half-barrel roof soon became emblematic of building with the material. Admirers had no doubt of its radical nature. One, in the “Register of the Arts and Sciences”, deemed the Turpentine Shed’s roof to be “the lightest and strongest roof (for its weight), that has been constructed by man, since the days of Adam”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Palmer’s large-span roofs found ready use on naval slipways, where ships had hitherto been constructed in the open. Corrugated iron also enabled the grand new termini of the burgeoning railways. None was more impressive than Paddington station, built in 1854 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It remains unchanged, in essence, even today.</p><p class="article__body-text">Rust was corrugated iron’s first problem. Galvanisation—coating it with corrosion-resistant zinc—was the solution. By the mid-19th century Britain’s galvanising industry was using 10,000 tonnes of zinc a year. When, in 1856, Henry Bessemer created a revolutionary furnace that blew air through molten iron to drive out impurities and create steel, the demand for galvanising grew further. Steel is more formable and ductile than iron, and stronger. It is also more prone to rust.</p><p class="article__body-text">Around the middle of the 19th century, a more democratic impulse came to embody corrugated iron. It emerged, oddly, with a royal nudge at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations. One of the defining events of the time, it was held in 1851 in Crystal Palace in London’s Hyde Park. A third of Britain’s population flocked to it. The exhibition was intended to showcase the wonders of the industrial age.</p><p class="article__body-text">Queen Victoria’s consort, Prince Albert, was the exhibition’s chief patron. Among all the exhibits, homely Albert was struck most by an emigrant’s corrugated-iron cottage. He ordered something similar for Balmoral, the royal residence in Scotland. Just weeks later it had been fabricated, shipped and erected. Today, it serves the estate as a carpenter's shop.</p><p class="article__body-text">Albert’s blessing spurred the trade in portable, timber-framed, corrugated-clad buildings. Also helping were the early gold rushes of California (1848) and Australia (1851)—where this “universal material” really came into its own. Within a year of gold being found in New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria, 500,000 immigrants were scouring the land for new finds. British manufacturers rushed to provide shelter. Shipping firms exporting wool from Australia to Europe gladly took cargoes of corrugated iron on the return trip. Immigrants to Australia often shipped their own pre-fab homes with them. South Melbourne’s “Canvas Town”, a shanty encampment of prospectors and traders, acquired a more permanent air thanks to corrugated-iron kits for cottages and shops arriving on the quay.</p><p class="article__body-text">Land dealings on the new frontiers of Australia and New Zealand were notoriously dodgy. In case of eviction, having a portable house was a distinct advantage—you did not lose everything. Thanks also to cheapness, portability and a relatively rust-free climate, “wrinkly tin” blazed across the frontier landscape of the Antipodes. From kennels to post offices and even the outdoor dunny, there seemed nothing tin could not do. In urban settings, tin cottages gave way to bungalows with verandahs, and then structures of two or more storeys. In New Zealand tin was given a new lease on life in 1936, with the fixing of a 40-hour week and two days out of every seven for leisure. The national craze for the weekend “bach”, a Kiwi dacha, was born. Baches are among New Zealand’s most iconic buildings—largely because of tin.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>After God, in the story of corrugated iron, comes war</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Back in Britain, corrugated-iron churches for the new settlements in Australia, Burma, Canada and beyond were designed to seat hundreds of congregants. Before shipping, they would be erected to check nothing was missing. The occasion was public and festive. Services and even dances were held inside.</p><p class="article__body-text">Churches for export also primed a new domestic market for corrugated churches, chapels and mission halls. These are Britain’s “tin tabernacles”. The radical structures were the antithesis of the medieval stone parish churches that till then had embodied religion, the English landscape and a paternalistic social order.</p><h2>The ripple effect</h2><p class="article__body-text">Two broad forces were at work. The first was a population on the move, a consequence of an intense period of population growth and industrialisation. Poor, rural classes flocked to new centres of industry and mining. In the other direction, prospering middle classes sought distance from satanic mills and miasmic air by looking to the new suburbs. The demand for new places of worship followed. There was also a moral and social upheaval, typified by improving education, a growing awareness of class and a wave of religious “revivals”. Paternalism was there, in places, but with the new religiosity came a questioning of the established church. Iron churches, writes Nick Thomson in “Corrugated Iron Buildings”, were the “perfect synthesis of industrial ability and social or spiritual need”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The catalogues of the iron-makers were swift to cater to the new trend. Church kits offered gothic windows and belfries. They started at under £100 (about £12,000 ($15,800) today), including shipping to the nearest railway goods station and erection on ready-made foundations. Landowners and industrialists were persuaded to part with a scrap of ground, and within weeks, the structure would be up. The cost per soul must have seemed a bargain.</p><p class="article__body-text">In today’s post-industrial age, populations have moved on again, mainly to exurbia. Many of the surviving tin tabernacles float in empty quarters, at a rural crossroads or under the overgrown boughs of abandoned orchards. One landmark in Shrubland Road in east London has passed through the hands of several denominations. Now the building stands for sale, presumably destined to become homes for hipsters.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/xmas-edition-images/XMP527.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">After God, in the story of corrugated iron, comes war. In 1916, halfway through the first world war, a Canadian engineer in the British Army, Peter Nissen, came up with a half-cylindrical building for billeting troops or storing equipment. A handful of men could put up a Nissen hut in four hours, transforming soldiers’ comfort. In the second world war, a larger version, the Quonset hut, evolved in America. Hundreds of thousands were made. Two Nissen huts, joined end to end, underwent an apotheosis on Scotland’s Orkney Isles at the hands of Italian prisoners-of-war. The Italian Chapel features a rood screen fashioned from steel reinforcing rods, and lanterns made of corned-beef tins. A painted Madonna and Child rise behind the altar. The walls and ceiling are covered with <em>trompe l’oeil</em> depictions of saints and Italian landscapes. The ornate whole is a masterpiece of suffering willed into hope.</p><p class="article__body-text">Across the poor world, tin still lies at the heart of informal settlements: urbanisation rolls out sheet by corrugated sheet. As well as representing shelter and adaptability, corrugated iron serves both as currency and community glue. Tin has less obvious adaptations: leave plastic bottles of water on top of a tin roof, and the reflected light and radiation will help kill bacteria in the water. Stick the same bottle through a hole in a tin roof, and you have an instant solar lamp.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the rich world, tin has acquired a hipness that acknowledges its back-story and its “authenticity”, to employ a much-abused word, in pursuit of a simpler, more essential way of living. In particular, a handful of Australian architects, notably Glenn Murcutt, Richard Leplastrier and Ken Maher, celebrate the tradition of corrugated iron in a modern context. Mr Murcutt’s buildings “touch the earth lightly”, a phrase he borrows from ancient aboriginal precepts. Mr Maher’s Olympic Park Station in Sydney, built to bring spectators to the 2000 games, has a spectacular vaulted roof that pays homage to Australia’s corrugated tradition, Mr Maher says, while leaving the traveller with a powerful sense of emerging into the light. A long way from that quivering sheet in the Dartmoor hedge, but all the more reason to allow your eye, next time you are out and about, to settle on the humble, unsung tin. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PHOTOGRAPHS: MATTHEW HOARE, DDP, GETTY IMAGES</small></p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/christmas-style-fixes/index.html"></iframe></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Christmas Specials section of the print edition under the headline "Gimme shelter"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20rise%20and%20rise%20of%20corrugated%20iron&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fpnhd2nucps8i7oupnfbnmd4q3jkfi95s&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
