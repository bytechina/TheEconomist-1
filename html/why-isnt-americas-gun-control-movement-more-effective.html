For many observers the marches will elicit déjà vu—and even weariness. A year after the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, hundreds of thousands of protesters had descended on Washington for what was then the country’s largest-ever gun-control rally. It yielded nothing in Congress; lawmakers have not tightened federal gun laws meaningfully since 1994. If they pass legislation now <a data-tegid="9fieiq5td5snpu4qnt2qepct5qvb5s8f" href="./gun-reform-finally-seems-possible.html">it will be modest</a>. Although a narrow (and <a href="./fewer-americans-want-stricter-gun-control.html">shrinking</a>) majority of Americans want <a href="./why-america-should-make-it-harder-to-buy-guns.html">tougher restrictions</a>, ambitious measures are off the table. There is no prospect of universal background checks—which 88% of Americans favour—or a ban on assault weapons. Why have gun-control advocates struggled to channel support for reform?</p><p class="article__body-text">Gun control has plenty of supporters but not enough campaigners. In the 20th century the gun lobby linked firearm ownership to personal responsibility and good citizenship. The National Rifle Association’s (<small>NRA</small>) publications and training courses—which enroll over 1m participants a year—claim that Second-Amendment rights are under threat. The gun-control lobby lacked a similarly compelling identity, at least until it coalesced around school shootings. Massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida in 2018 were particular spurs. Survivors and victims’ relatives <a href="./students-lead-a-vast-protest-against-gun-violence.html">formed pressure groups</a>. Across the country parents joined local chapters. Framing the issue as one of child protection gave it broad appeal. Funds poured in from donors, including from Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire. But the gun lobby’s war chest still dwarfs those funds: in 2016, the<small> NRA</small> and three other big groups had almost five times as much cash as the six largest gun-control organisations. Firearm owners are twice as likely as non-owners to petition their congressmen and nearly five times as likely to donate to candidates or groups that share their views on guns, according to Pew Research Centre, a think-tank.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But gun-control advocates have changed their strategy too. In the 1970s they sought big reforms and rejected incremental steps as inadequate. In 1975 when Gerald Ford, a Republican president, proposed a ban on “Saturday-night specials” (cheap, small-calibre handguns), Democrats balked, holding out for a total handgun ban that never materialised. More than a decade passed without a congressional vote on gun control. In the years since Sandy Hook, reformers have pursued incremental change in some states: improving background checks, raising the gun-buying age, removing firearms from domestic abusers and people who behave threateningly. Nearly 300 gun-control laws have passed—many in liberal states but some in states usually averse to restrictions, such as Florida, Vermont and Virginia.</p><p class="article__body-text">This piecemeal approach is riddled with holes. Firearms cross state lines. Gun-loving states have <a href="./many-states-are-pushing-through-more-permissive-gun-laws.html">loosened laws</a> through “<a href="./permitless-carry-gun-laws-are-misguided-and-should-be-scrapped.html">permitless carry</a>”, letting owners pack heat in public without a licence. Courts can undo state restrictions: in May a federal appeals court overturned California’s ban on selling semi-automatic weapons to buyers aged 18 to 21. The Supreme Court may soon limit states’ authority to regulate firearms in public; its ruling on a case from New York is due soon. Though gun-control campaigners are better funded and organised than they were at their march in Washington 22 years ago, the real prize—bold federal legislation—remains just as elusive. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./will-there-soon-be-a-surplus-of-lithium.html">Will there soon be a surplus of lithium?</a><br/><a href="./is-kaliningrad-russias-exclave-surrounded-by-eu-countries-an-asset-or-a-liability.html">Is Kaliningrad, Russia’s exclave surrounded by EU countries, an asset or a liability?</a><br/><a href="./who-are-the-gupta-brothers-and-what-does-their-arrest-mean-for-south-africa.html">Who are the Gupta brothers and what does their arrest mean for South Africa?</a></p></div></body></html>
