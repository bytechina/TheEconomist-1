Unlucky patients told of the disorientating experience of anosmia, as the condition is known. Food was sapped of its flavour, nature of its beauty.</p><p class="article__body-text">As Elise Vernon Pearlstine chronicles in “Scent”, humans have long derived pleasure from the smells of the natural world. For the most part, though, <i>Homo sapiens</i> is not their target market. For plants, fragrances are a way to interact with insects and other animals. Their attraction for people is merely fortuitous.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In chemical terms, most natural fragrances are made up of volatile organic compounds, or volatiles—so called because of their tendency to change states suddenly. Volatiles evaporate easily, drifting into noses. One example is limonene, a simple citrus-smelling compound. Santalene, found in sandalwood, is another: a heavier compound, it takes longer to evaporate, providing the long-lasting “base” notes in many fragrances.</p><p class="article__body-text">In plants’ reproductive processes, smelly volatiles attract pollinators. But their natural applications are much more varied. Frankincense and myrrh resins protect wounded tree bark, forming a sort of odiferous scab that helps fend off infection and attack. If an insect chews through the leaves of some Bursera plants, out shoots a sticky, smelly resin to trap them. Coyote tobacco plants are even more crafty: upon sensing the secretions of hungry caterpillars, they produce volatiles that attract predators to dispatch the pests.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Pearlstine stresses just how wily plants can be in deploying their aromas for reproduction. White flowers often emit their scent at night, to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. They produce a dilute nectar that encourages moths to keep moving, rather than linger at a single bloom—all the better to increase pollination. Other flowers change their fragrance after being successfully pollinated, as a signal for insects to go elsewhere.</p><p class="article__body-text">But though “Scent” is a story of plants’ ingenuity, it is also a tale of the human kind. People have long commandeered fragrances for their own purposes, particularly for use in religious ceremonies: perfume recipes on the walls of an Egyptian temple in Edfu demonstrate just how long ingredients have been mixed in pursuit of an optimal blend. So highly prized were some scents that, to scare off competitors, Arab traders spread a legend about giant eagles that reputedly guarded cinnamon.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Eventually scientists no longer needed natural sources for fragrances. In 1866 an aroma molecule was synthesised for the first time. Sixteen years later Houbigant Parfum released Fougère Royale, which Ms Pearlstine calls the first “modern fantasy perfume” as it creates an imaginary scent rather than replicating a natural one. Nowadays fragrance-making is dominated by synthetic compounds, which can be reliably and affordably produced in bulk. </p><p class="article__body-text">That has led to the proliferation of smelly products, from toilet paper to toothpaste. Scent is accordingly big business. Syrmise, a fragrance and flavour manufacturer that claims people interact with its products up to 30 times a day, had sales of €3.8bn ($4.5bn) last year. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
