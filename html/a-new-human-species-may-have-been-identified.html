The cranium in question was dug up in Harbin in 1933 and is held at Hebei <small>GEO</small> University, in Shijiazhuang. It is 146,000 years old and was originally badged as an archaic form of <em>Homo sapiens</em>. But Ni Xijun and Ji Qiang, who work at the university, disagree. As they report in the <em>Innovation</em>, the cranium would indeed have contained a brain similar in size to a modern human’s, but the fossil is too large to be <em>sapiens</em> and has molars and eye sockets which dwarf those of people today. Dr Ni and Dr Ji also realised that it is too long and low to be <em>sapiens</em>. It lacks the roundness of a modern human cranium.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This is good news for supporters of the recent-African-origin theory, which holds that most non-African human beings alive today are descendants of a small number of migrants who crossed to Asia from the Horn of Africa about 60,000 years ago, meaning that any non-African human fossil from before that date is probably of another species descended from earlier, non-<em>sapiens</em> departures from Africa.</p><p class="article__body-text">The question was, which earlier species did the Harbin fossil represent? By comparing it with known archaic humans, including <em>Homo erectus</em>, <em>Homo floresiensis</em>, <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> and <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>, Dr Ni and Dr Ji concluded that it was none of them, and must therefore be new to science and so worthy of its own name. There is, however, one other possibility—for there is a now-extinct type of human of which no cranium has yet been identified. <em>Homo denisova</em>‘s existence was established by the extraction of <small>DNA</small> from a finger bone, and traces of that <small>DNA</small>, a remnant of interspecies breeding, still exist in modern humans, notably in China. Since one of the Harbin fossil’s molars perfectly matches the size and root structure of a molar from the Denisova cave in Russia, after which <em>Homo denisova</em> is named, it may be that Dr Ni and Dr Ji have actually identified the first Denisovan cranium.</p><p class="article__body-text">The other study, published in <em>Science</em> by Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University, also speaks to the question of interspecific interbreeding. Even supporters of the recent-African-origin theory recognise that there was, in addition, an earlier “leakage” of <em>Homo sapiens</em> from north-east Africa into the Levant. Dr Hershkovitz and his colleagues have been examining fossils of relevant antiquity—120,000-140,000 years—collected from Nesher Ramla, a site in Israel. These, they found, have <em>sapiens</em>-like jaw bones, Neanderthal-like molars and crania similar to those of <em>Homo erectus</em>. This suggests to them that they are the product of miscegenation between all three.</p><p class="article__body-text">That so much interbreeding went on between groups of people who had evolved separately for hundreds of thousands of years is intriguing. Besides the imprint of Denisovan genes in modern Asians, it is also known that modern Europeans bear traces of Neanderthals and that some modern Africans similarly bear the imprint of a “ghost” hominid for which no fossil evidence has yet been found. The ancestry of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, it seems, is less a family tree than a worldwide web. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>A version of this article was published online on June 25th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "A new human species?"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20new%20human%20species%20may%20have%20been%20identified&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-01&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F9jpuv7jktnc0brc98ieitd8mrb8jb4fb&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
