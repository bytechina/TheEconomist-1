The business took off in 2008, when the government banned imports of cars of more than five years old. The old bangers continued to clatter in, illegally.</p><p class="article__body-text">The fair in Challapata is the biggest in the country. The <em>chuteros</em> make little attempt to hide themselves. Mechanics fix suspension wrecked by the drive over the mountains from Chile; others move steering wheels from right to left. <em>Chutos</em> are advertised on Facebook, along with fake licence plates. Younger <em>chuteros</em> post videos of themselves on TikTok, a video-sharing app, racing over the salt flats, set to their own music genre, <em>chutocumbia</em>, in which singers croon about the hardship they endure to feed their families.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The government has tried to beef up controls along the border with Chile. But Bolivia is poor and the border is long; the flow of <em>chutos</em> has not abated. Smugglers say they pay $100 a car for border guards to look away. Police who catch a <em>chuto </em>inside Bolivia can be bribed, too.</p><p class="article__body-text">A <em>chuto</em> costs around half or even a third as much as a legally imported car. Buyers avoid not only import tariffs, but also an annual road tax. The government is wary of cracking down, mostly because of the sheer number of people who would be affected.</p><p class="article__body-text">Instead in 2011 the government allowed owners of <em>chutos</em> to register their cars, provided they could prove the vehicle had not been stolen in another country. Those doing so had to start paying road tax, but would no longer risk extortion if caught by the police. Ruben Ferrufino, a spokesperson for a group of <em>chuto </em>owners, is pushing for another amnesty. If not, his group is threatening to impose road blocks—another common sight in Bolivia.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Honk for impunity"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Bolivia%20is%20awash%20with%20contraband%20cars%20from%20Japan&amp;publicationDate=2022-03-05&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F8bqif5ieeumd5085ob768pa43ml538e4&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
