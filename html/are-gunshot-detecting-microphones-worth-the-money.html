You will see that many of them have protuberances sticking several feet above the light. These are microphones operated by ShotSpotter, a firm with its headquarters in California. They are spread over a large part of Chicago, and they capture the sounds of gunshots. Algorithms pick out the sounds, which are then verified by humans listening in from a control centre in Washington, <small>DC</small>. Triangulating the sounds from several microphones reveals where the guns were fired. Police are alerted and rush to the scene, quicker than if they had to wait for a 911 call—especially one that may not come.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/are-gunshot-detecting-microphones-worth-the-money.mp3" title="Are gunshot-detecting microphones worth the money?"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">That is the idea, anyway. Over the past 25 years, ShotSpotter’s technology has spread across America. It is now used in more than 100 cities. Chicago is its biggest market, with the police department paying around $11m a year for the service, accounting for almost a fifth of the firm’s revenue. In the past year Chicago has had 795 homicide victims, almost all from shootings.</p><p class="article__body-text">The use of the sensors is increasingly controversial, in Chicago and elsewhere. In August the Chicago Office of the Inspector General (<small>OIG</small>), a city watchdog, produced a report questioning the usefulness of the technology. On November 12th the city council’s public-safety committee held a special hearing to question the police and the firm about the concerns. On November 3rd Baltimore decided to renew its contract, but narrowly: the mayor, Brandon Scott, declared that he is the “biggest sceptic” and that evaluations would continue. Other cities, such as Charlotte, in North Carolina, have ended their contracts. Is the technology worth it?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">According to the <small>OIG</small>, of just over 50,000 alerts generated by the system between January 2020 and May 2021, only about 2% led to the police stopping somebody. Only 0.4% of alerts resulted in arrests and even fewer the recovery of weapons. A separate study by the MacArthur Justice Centre, a civil-rights law firm affiliated with Northwestern University, found that in just 10% of cases generated by the system could police find evidence of a shooting, such as spent cartridge cases or bullet holes.</p><p class="article__body-text">And yet each alert is treated as equivalent to a shooting in progress, says Jonathan Manes, of the MacArthur centre, which means multiple police officers rush to the scene. In Chicago police respond to roughly 60 alerts per day. Those resources, as well as the money spent on the system itself, could be used to investigate crimes that have been reported, he says. Less than half of murders in Chicago are solved.</p><p class="article__body-text">“ShotSpotter technology does not deter crime or shootings,” says Ray Kelly of the Citizens Policing Project, a group in Baltimore that presses for closer relations between the police and citizens. “So what is the benefit?” In Chicago, police-reform activists point to the trial of Michael Williams, a 65-year-old black man who was arrested last year on charges of murder. The prosecution presented evidence from the ShotSpotter system to argue that he had killed a young man in his car. The case proved flimsy, and in July Mr Williams was released. In another case, in March, an unarmed 13-year-old boy was shot and killed by police responding to an alert.</p><p class="article__body-text">Deborah Witzburg, who was deputy inspector-general for public safety in Chicago until November 12th, points out that the city’s police department, which has a long history of abuse allegations, has a “legitimacy deficit”. Sending armed cops in numbers to respond to computerised alerts seems unlikely to help build trust.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The firm defends the effectiveness of its system. It points to plenty of cases where ShotSpotter alerts resulted in arrests or the timely rescue of gunshot victims. But there is little independent evidence that it reduces crime overall. One study, published in April in the <em>Journal of Urban Health</em>, found that “implementing ShotSpotter technology has no significant impact on firearm-related homicides or arrest outcomes”. Microphones on street-lights are all very well, but they are no substitute for information gathered from humans. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America, <a href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Shot spotty"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Are%20gunshot-detecting%20microphones%20worth%20the%20money%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fcloao8dgba1gsp6et9nshrpqbumg2d61&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
