Later she had her portrait painted dressed in black with Spanish lace ruffs. But she is kneeling on a luxurious carpet of brightly coloured geometric design derived from pre-Columbian Peruvian culture. The painting hangs in “Tornaviaje” (Return Journey), a thought-provoking exhibition at the Prado museum in Madrid, whose subject is the art produced in Spanish America from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It argues that this art, in the words of an 18th-century Spanish friar, featured “Spanish forms dressed in American clothing” and thus formed part of a culture of <em>mestizaje</em> (mixing).</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/politicians-are-sparring-over-colonial-history-in-latin-america.mp3" title="Politicians are sparring over colonial history in Latin America"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The exhibition comes as Spain’s colonisation of the Americas is generating political polemic. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is still smouldering after Spain rebuffed his request in 2019 that its king should apologise for the conquest 500 years ago. Conservative Spanish politicians have stoked resentment. The conquest “brought civilisation and freedom to the American continent”, said Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Madrid regional president, in September. This overlooks the sophisticated civilisations of pre-Columbian Peru and Mexico, the fact that the conquest meant death by disease for millions of native Americans and that “freedom” would come only after independence from Spain three centuries later.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">“Tornaviaje” offers a more subtle view. Its contents are the art the descendants of the conquistadors sent back home. The curators scoured convents and private collections. It illuminates a blind spot. Most Spaniards are unaware that their forebears lived with more objects from the Americas than from Flanders or Italy, or that many of the Christs they parade behind in Easter processions or the chalices in their churches were made in America, writes Miguel Falomir, the museum’s director.</p><p class="article__body-text">Like all migrants, Spaniards wanted to tell the folks back home of their success. The show includes paintings and maps of new cities, such as Mexico and Potosí, as well as portraits of the colonial elite dressed in Spanish finery. It does not conceal the fact of racial inequality: the daughter of a viceroy pats an indigenous servant on the head. But it also celebrates the emergence of a <em>mestizo</em> (mixed-race) society and artistic culture. An 18th-century painting of a Mexican family bears the legend “qualities of the mixture of Spaniards, blacks and Indians”.</p><p class="article__body-text">The “American clothing” involved native techniques and materials, such as silver, feathers, dyes and woods, and skilled artists. Spanish America developed a visual culture that lasts to this day, featuring popular religiosity (especially the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe, who revealed herself to an indigenous shepherd), ostentatious public display and jubilation in the fiesta, and a celebration of the abundance of the land. This distinct cultural tradition eventually assumed political form in the movement for independence from Spain.</p><p class="article__body-text">None of this obscures the subordination of the indigenous population, a cause of Latin America’s chronic inequality which intensified after independence. In another, smaller, exhibition in Madrid Sandra Gamarra, a contemporary Peruvian artist, takes images from that visual tradition and turns them on their heads. Her artworks seek to show the persistence of colonial trauma and the invisibility of native cultures and <em>mestizo</em> variations in Latin America today. Nineteenth-century paintings celebrating independence are blurred by a red wash. A large triangle of triangles recalls the form of the Virgin of the silver mountain of Potosí and contains 350 smaller images of the virgin painted by artists who sell to tourists in Cusco. Copies of European academic paintings she bought in flea markets are placed face down on the floor in the form of a <em>chakana</em>, an Inca cross which symbolises the interdependence of everything.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Ms Gamarra’s work highlights that the official narrative of <em>mestizaje</em> falls short by not acknowledging continuing racial discrimination, though arguably Latin American culture is ever more demotic and <em>mestizo</em>. “Tornaviaje” presents historical evidence that <em>mestizaje </em>was at the heart of colonial art and culture. But the remedy for enduring stratification by race is not politics focused on identity, but rather fairness. The historic task of Latin American democracy continues to be to give equal value to all citizens, whatever their race.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Read more from Bello, our columnist on Latin America:<br/></strong><em><a href="./latin-america-waits-for-tourists-to-return.html">Latin America waits for tourists to return</a> (Nov 27th 2021)<strong><br/></strong><a href="./will-electoral-defeat-favour-moderation-in-argentina.html">Will electoral defeat favour moderation in Argentina?</a> (Nov 20th 2021)<br/><a href="./president-jair-bolsonaro-is-bad-for-brazils-economy.html">President Jair Bolsonaro is bad for Brazil’s economy</a> (Nov 13th 2021)</em><strong><br/></strong></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Pictures at two exhibitions"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Politicians%20are%20sparring%20over%20colonial%20history%20in%20Latin%20America&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ft9pjfe8fvmg2a0rd3egk0qitgi1ene05&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
