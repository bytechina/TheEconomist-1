Yet is is no match for a country of just 7.6m inhabitants in the Pacific Ocean: Papua New Guinea. There are nearly 850 languages spoken in the country, making it the most linguistically diverse place on earth. Why does Papua New Guinea have so many languages, and how do locals cope? </p><p class="article__body-text">The oldest group of languages in Papua New Guinea are the so-called “Papuan” languages, introduced by the first human settlers 40,000 years ago. Despite falling under the “Papuan” umbrella, these languages do not share a single root. Instead, they are split into dozens of unrelated families (with some isolates—languages with no relatives at all—left over). This contrasts with Papua New Guinea’s Austronesian languages, which arrived some 3,500 years ago, probably from a single Taiwanese source. Things were further complicated in the 1800s by the arrival of English- and German-speaking colonists. After independence, Papua New Guinea adopted three official languages. English is the first. Tok Pisin, a creole, is the second; Hiri Motu, a simplified version of Motu, an Austronesian language, is the third. (Sign language was added in 2015.) But the lack of state recognition did not quash variety. The country’s 850-odd languages each enjoy between a few dozen and 650,000 speakers. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In part, so many of these languages have survived thanks to Papua New Guinea’s wild topography. Mountains, jungles and swamps keep villagers isolated, preserving their languages. A rural population helps too: only about 13% of Papuans live in towns. Indeed, some Papuans have never had any contact with the outside world. Fierce tribal divisions—Papua New Guinea is often shaken by communal violence—also encourages people to be proud of their own languages. The passing of time is another important factor. It takes about a thousand years for a single language to split in two, says William Foley, a linguist. With 40,000 years to evolve, Papuan languages have had plenty of time to change naturally. </p><p class="article__body-text">In the face of this incredibly linguistic variety, Papuans have embraced Tok Pisin, a creole based on English, but with German, Portuguese and native Papuan languages mixed in. It started as a pidgin, developed by traders in the 19th century. (Its name is a pidginisation of “talk pidgin”.) But in recent decades, it has become the main language in Papua New Guinea. There is a Tok Pisin newspaper, and it is popular in church. Tok Pisin is now spoken by 4m Papuans, a majority of the population. Its root as a pidgin helps explain its success: simple vocabulary makes it easy to learn. Its mixed heritage also makes it dazzlingly expressive. <em>Pikinini</em> means “child” and comes from Portuguese. The Tok Pisin for “urbanite” is <em>susok man</em>—“shoe sock man” in English. Yet Tok Pisin’s success may also threaten Papua New Guinea’s linguistic diversity: it is also slowly crowding out other languages. A dozen have already vanished. As a modern Papuan language flourishes, ancient ones risk falling away. </p></div></body></html>
