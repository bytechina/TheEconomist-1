Donald Trump, his critics and the press all combined to reduce a complex and important bilateral relationship to a psychodrama about the mysterious affection between him and Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president.</p><p class="article__body-text">President Joe Biden is casting the relationship in far grander terms, as part of a long-term contest between democracy and autocracy, represented by Russia but principally by China. He intended both countries as the audience for the displays of unity within the G7, NATO and the EU over the past few days, leading up to his summit with Mr Putin, which took place in Geneva on June 16th.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden’s frame of reference is the cold war, in which he came of age as a politician fascinated by foreign policy. A mantra of this administration is that he wants “to restore predictability and stability” to America’s relationship with Russia, to create a basis for relations to be workmanlike if also adversarial, as they mostly were with the Soviets.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet the cold-war pageantry is in some ways a greater compliment to Mr Putin than were the blandishments of Mr Trump. Mr Biden’s aides acknowledge that Mr Putin is notching up a political victory just by sharing the spotlight with an American president, as in the days when the Soviet Union was one of two great superpowers. But this concession to Mr Putin’s vanity may incline him to make less trouble, Mr Biden’s team hopes, as they try to project a new example of democratic vitality and global leadership. It is far from clear, however, that this will be the case.</p><p class="article__body-text"><html><body><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/present-tense-bidenandputinmeet.mp3" title=""><p></p></audio></body></html></p><p class="article__body-text">Going into the summit, Mr Biden gave Mr Putin another win by waiving sanctions on the company behind the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline that a Russian-led consortium is building under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing the existing network through Poland and Ukraine. Mr Biden’s aides say that decision was a concession not to Russia but to Germany, and to reality. The pipeline is more than 90% complete, Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, told Congress last week; he did not want America’s relationship with Germany, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/15/joe-biden-seeks-to-clobber-russia-with-new-economic-sanctions">which is very keen on the projec</a>t, to be “poisoned” by American opposition. Mr Blinken said that Germany and America were discussing how to compensate Ukraine for any lost transit fees, and how to punish Russia if it cuts off Ukraine’s gas, as the Ukrainian government fears will become more likely.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The pipeline is among the problems with Russia that Mr Biden is expected to raise at the summit. Another is Mr Putin’s repression of dissent, including the jailing of Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, and the banning of his groups. Again, however, it is not clear what, if anything, Mr Biden intends to do when the clamp-down continues, as it surely will. Mr Biden also intends to press Mr Putin on his continued menacing of Ukraine, for instance with a huge troop-build up on the border in April.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden’s aides say the president will demand that Mr Putin take action against Russian cyber-gangs believed to be behind recent ransomware attacks in America. Mr Biden is under bipartisan pressure to threaten to retaliate with America’s own cyber-weapons if Mr Putin fails to halt groups like Fancy Bear, which is thought to have hacked the Democratic Party ahead of America’s elections in 2016.</p><p class="article__body-text">Despite Republican indulgence of Mr Putin in Mr Trump’s day, Mr Biden can expect harsh criticism if he fails to read Mr Putin the riot act. Appearing on the American cable network MSNBC, John Bolton, who was briefly Mr Trump’s national security adviser, called the decision on Nord Stream 2 “a signal to Putin that Biden may talk tough, but the action doesn’t follow.” Mr Bolton said he saw “considerable downside” in providing Mr Putin the forum of a summit.</p><p class="article__body-text">For his part, Mr Putin has signalled he has no patience for lectures about what he considers internal matters. He warned in an interview with NBC News last week that the relationship “has deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years”. Yet when he described his hopes for the relationship, he used the same words as the administration: “predictability and stability”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden’s team does believe that there are a few areas in which the two countries might work together. First among these is arms control. Mr Biden and Mr Putin have already agreed to extend New START, an agreement negotiated under Barack Obama that reduces each country's number of deployed nuclear weapons by 30%. Rose Gottemoeller, a lecturer at Stanford University and former deputy secretary-general of NATO, says Mr Putin would like to limit America’s highly accurate long-range conventional systems, which he considers to have the same strategic effect as nuclear weapons. Mr Biden wants to limit Russia’s “exotic” weapons systems, like nuclear-propelled torpedoes, which are not covered by New START. Both leaders want stricter limits on all nuclear warheads. “Having that next arms-control treaty on the way will be a message they will both want coming out of this meeting,” Ms Gottemoeller says. “They need to give some pretty stiff messages to their governments to get on with it.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Other potential areas for co-operation include limiting Iran’s nuclear programme, providing humanitarian assistance in Syria and preventing the Afghan government from collapsing as America withdraws. Mr Biden is also seeking Mr Putin’s collaboration against climate change.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Putin and Mr Biden are expected to discuss reversing the tit-for-tat closures of consulates that have left America with only one diplomatic mission in Russia, its embassy in Moscow. It will be a bad sign indeed if the two leaders do not at least agree to return their ambassadors. Each was recalled in April, after Mr Biden imposed <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/15/joe-biden-seeks-to-clobber-russia-with-new-economic-sanctions">new sanctions</a> on Russia in retaliation for the <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/12/14/hackers-have-vaulted-into-the-heart-of-americas-government">cyber-hack known as SolarWinds</a>.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden has decided to skip the awkward dynamics of a joint press conference after the meeting, a sign that he has little expectation of projecting new comity. Instead, he will meet alone with the press—the “free press”, his aides have repeatedly stressed, in a dig at Mr Putin.</p><p class="article__body-text">For Mr Trump, the uproar surrounding his meetings with Mr Putin had one benefit: no one much noticed that he made no headway with Russia on matters of substance. Mr Biden will have no such cover. He has tried to lower expectations, but the stakes are high for him. This meeting will be the first test of the mixed-message foreign policy he is pursuing with Russia and China. He aims both to deliver condemnation in some areas and to offer co-operation in others. Making convincing progress in either respect will be hard.</p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of Joe Biden’s presidency, visit our dedicated <a href="./president-joe-biden.html"> hub</a></em></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20summit%20with%20Vladimir%20Putin%20tests%20Joe%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20new%20foreign%20policy&amp;publicationDate=2021-06-15&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F9h088esaucshs6ojmeo881rcbj5hjqga&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
