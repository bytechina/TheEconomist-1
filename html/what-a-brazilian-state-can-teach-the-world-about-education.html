The city of 200,000 people lies in Ceará, a baking-hot north-eastern state that has one of Brazil’s highest rates of poverty. When local officials ordered tests in 2001 they found that 40% of Sobral’s eight-year-olds could not read at all. One-third of primary pupils had been held back for at least a year. Staff were not always much better, recalls Mr Gomes. He remembers a head teacher who signed documents with a thumbprint, because she lacked the confidence even to scribble her own name.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/what-a-brazilian-state-can-teach-the-world-about-education.mp3" title="What a Brazilian state can teach the world about education"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">These days Mr Gomes is the boss of a local teacher-training college, and his city gets visitors from across Brazil. In 2015 Sobral’s primary-school children made headlines by scoring highest in the country in tests of maths and literacy, a milestone in a journey begun almost 20 years before. The pandemic has thrust the city back into the spotlight as a model for educators seeking to reboot schooling after lengthy closures. In November ambitious officials from other parts of Brazil trooped into Mr Gomes’s college, the first group since the start of the pandemic to attend one of the tours Sobral offers to curious outsiders.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Success stories are important to Brazil’s beleaguered educators, now more than ever. Before the pandemic only about half of children could read by the time they finished primary school, compared with nearly three-quarters in other upper-middle-income countries. In 2017 the World Bank warned that it could take 260 years before Brazil’s 15-year-olds are reading and writing as well as peers in the rich world. Since then many Brazilian pupils have missed around 18 months of face-to-face lessons as a result of school closures (most schools have now reopened). Few countries kept classrooms shut for as long. Data from São Paulo suggest that during this period children learned less than a third of what they normally would have, and that the risk of pupils dropping out tripled.</p><p class="article__body-text">Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, seems to have no meaningful plan to get teaching back on track. Even before covid-19 his educational policies were meagre. He said he wanted more schools to be run by the army and for Congress to legalise home-schooling. Yet his chaotic administration has not made much progress towards even these eccentric goals. It has churned through four education ministers in three years. There is one consolation, says Priscila Cruz of All for Education, a charity based in São Paulo. She thinks the vacuum in the federal government is making municipal and state officials keener to seek lessons from each other.</p><p class="article__body-text">The success in Sobral has roots in reforms begun in the late 1990s. In much of Brazil, city governments appoint their friends or political allies to serve as school principals. Officials in Sobral insisted that these jobs go only to candidates who could win them on merit after competing in interviews and tests.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211218_AMC231.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211218_AMC231.png" srcset="../image/20211218_AMC231.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The city shut small schools in outlying areas, where staff commonly taught children in several grades at once. Merging them with bigger ones allowed more pupils to learn from Sobral’s best teachers, and cut costs. This reorganisation has helped keep spending per pupil below the national average, according to the World Bank (see chart).</p><p class="article__body-text">In the classroom, Sobral has focused obsessively on making sure small children can read. The city determined that every pupil would master basic literacy before entering the third grade (when they are aged eight or nine). Examiners began listening to all children in their first years of school read aloud. These days local professionals run city-wide tests in maths and Portuguese for all grades. Teachers earn bonuses if their pupils hit minimum targets. Lesson plans pumped out by the city ensure that no teacher need start a class unprepared. Every teacher spends a day a month in training.</p><p class="article__body-text">Not much of what Sobral has done would surprise reformers in richer countries, says Claudia Costin, an academic who used to run Rio de Janeiro’s school system. But that is not the point. “The beauty of Sobral”, says Ms Cruz of All for Education, “is that they do the obvious things very well.” The city has a dogged willingness to implement “what the evidence says works”.</p><p class="article__body-text">What makes Sobral’s story most compelling is that it has touched off improvements all across Ceará. In 2006 bigwigs from the city were elected to run the state government. They, in turn, gave cities more power to run their own schools. They also introduced a statewide literacy test for eight-year-olds, and increased the amount of training and flow of materials to teachers. Most notably, they made a bit of the money each city gets from the state dependent on improving school results. That gives mayors ample reason to put smart types in charge of schools, and gives other officials cause to help local education chiefs succeed.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">No state has seen school results rise as fast as Ceará since rigorous comparisons began in 2005. The latest data, from 2019, saw several local cities surge up a national ranking, even as scores in Sobral itself fell slightly. Twelve Cearan school systems ranked among Brazil’s 20 best (judged by the performance of primary schools). Sobral slipped from the top spot, after four years of triumph. That accolade went instead to Mucambo, less than an hour down the road. Curiously, towns and cities that lie just across Ceará’s borders with other states have also been creeping up the rankings, notes Daniel Santos at the University of São Paulo.</p><p class="article__body-text">New frontiers beckon. In 2018 Veveu Arruda, who served as Sobral’s mayor from 2011 to 2016, set up an organisation—supported by the Lemann Foundation, a big charity, among others—that aims to help governments elsewhere in Brazil mimic some of the region’s reforms. One of its programmes involves offering advice to governors in ten of Brazil’s 27 states. Another, which provides more hands-on help to municipal governments, will soon expand to around 50 cities.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Not everyone thinks formulae from Brazil’s north-east are sure to help schools in other regions. Sobral has probably benefited from its unusually stable politics. The same political clique has run city hall for 25 years. They have kept education a priority. The cities working with Mr Arruda are advised to select strategies they think best fit local conditions. One important thing, he says, is to cast off a mindset that “poor children cannot learn”. In Sobral and the rest of Ceará that meant disregarding well-meaning observers who said that disadvantaged children were bound to lag at school unless officials first resolved stubborn inequalities in income.</p><p class="article__body-text">For all that education is prized in Sobral, its performance during the pandemic has not been glorious. Local leaders chose to keep school buildings closed for just as long as did officials in much worse-run bits of Brazil. “We were scared,” admits Ivo Gomes, the mayor since 2017. Pupils made less progress than usual while learning online and from worksheets, says Herbert Lima, the city’s education secretary. But he insists the deficits are not as deep as those emerging in many other cities, and that very few pupils have dropped out. Sobral’s schools are far better prepared than most in Brazil to rescue pupils who lag behind their grade. “I know they can catch up,” says the mayor, “because I have seen them do it before.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Studying Ceará"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=What%20a%20Brazilian%20state%20can%20teach%20the%20world%20about%20education&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ft20cstl1cg6u7g31a4bcph5qn47gd4jv&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
