Instead of leading the broadcast and telecoms regulator, he would be taking up “an exciting new job in the private sector”. Three days later, to surprise on Fleet Street, it turned out that the new gig was a return to his old one: editor-in-chief at the parent company of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Britain’s most-read (and most-feared) newspaper.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/paul-dacre-scourge-of-the-establishment-returns-to-its-bosom.mp3" title="Paul Dacre, scourge of the Establishment, returns to its bosom"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Ofcom was an odd fit for Mr Dacre, who edited the <em>Mail</em> for 26 years and once dismissed online news as “bullshit.com”. The government nonetheless appeared set on him getting the job, reopening the selection process after he was rejected by an independent panel on his first attempt. Its enthusiasm for his candidacy only grew after it failed to install Lord Moore, a fellow culture-warrior, as chairman of the <small>BBC</small>. But accusations of cronyism grew too loud to ignore. Ofcom has until November 29th to find a new candidate.</p><p class="article__body-text">At the <em>Mail</em> Mr Dacre is already back in his old office, so recently vacated that he had not cleared his desk. After giving up day-to-day editorship in 2018 he moved upstairs to become editor-in-chief, an advisory role for which he earned £1.5m ($2m) last year. His advice fell on the deaf ears of Geordie Greig, an Old Etonian former <em>Tatler </em>editor who succeeded him at the <em>Mail </em>and toned down its attacks on establishment Remoaners. This time will be different. Days before Mr Dacre’s return was announced, Mr Greig was replaced by Ted Verity, a lifelong <em>Mail </em>man who will work hand in glove with his old boss.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Insiders expect a “tougher”, more outspoken paper, and closer integration with the Sunday edition (over which Mr Verity also presides) and the website. Trimming overlap would help offset the costs of energy and newsprint, which are rising as print sales slide. Circulation of the <em>Daily Mail</em> has fallen below 1m, half the level a decade ago. MailOnline, which has a popular line in celebrity content (this week: “red hot snaps” and “eye-popping cleavage”), accounted for 32% of the <em>Mail</em> businesses’ revenue in the most recent financial year, twice the share five years earlier.</p><p class="article__body-text">The need to reorganise is one reason why Jonathan Harmsworth, the fourth Viscount Rothermere, proposes to take the <em>Mail</em>’s parent company, the Daily Mail and General Trust, private. (His family holds a controlling stake.) Shaking things up may be easier without shareholder scrutiny. Lord Rothermere, whose great-grandfather co-founded the <em>Daily Mail</em> in 1896, has “never, ever enjoyed a meeting with an investor”, says a friend. Shareholders have until December 16th to decide whether to accept his offer.</p><p class="article__body-text">Private ownership would spare the family from investors’ moans about editorial choices; some shareholders have come to see Mr Dacre as toxic. It might also ease the process of succession, which is already being planned by Lord Rothermere, who is 53. His son Vere Harmsworth, four years out of Oxford, joined the family firm last year, and is apparently being groomed for the day when it falls to the fifth viscount to continue the <em>Mail</em>’s profitable fight against the Establishment. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em><strong>Correction (November 25th 2021): </strong>An earlier version of this article said Ted Verity will preside over the MailOnline.
