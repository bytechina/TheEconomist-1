Blandly named the “Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland”, the 63-page document succeeds in avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. But it does so by creating another border within the UK, which is causing new problems and threatening to undermine the peace in Northern Ireland. What exactly is the Northern Ireland protocol, and why is it so controversial?</p><style data-emotion="css bvf2nr">.css-bvf2nr{padding-bottom:1.5rem;margin:1.3125rem 0

href="./how-brexit-happened.html">UK voted to leave the EU</a> in 2016, the 95-year-old, 310-mile (500km) border that separates the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland had never been less noticeable. That was for two reasons. In 1973 the simultaneous entry of the UK and Ireland into what would become the EU started a process of economic harmonisation that eradicated customs posts and checks on goods. The army remained at checkpoints as a consequence of the “Troubles”—the 30-year sectarian conflict involving the Irish Republican Army, loyalist paramilitaries and the British security forces. But after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 largely ended the violence, those border posts also disappeared.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">By 2016, the only noticeable changes for someone driving across the border were the design of the road signs and the quality of the tarmac. That was important to Northern Ireland’s uneasy peace. Nationalists had temporarily settled for Ireland remaining partitioned, with Northern Ireland still part of the UK. But in return—as well as getting to share power with unionists—that border ceased to be a hard dividing line which symbolised how their campaign to free Ireland from Britain was incomplete.</p><p class="article__body-text">Once the British government decided that Brexit would mean leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, a border had to go somewhere. The UK said it would not erect border posts. But the EU objected, fearing that there would be nothing to stop the UK flouting EU regulatory standards and pouring inferior products into Ireland from whence they could travel across the EU. The solution—which Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, at first said was unconscionable, but came to accept as the price of Brexit—was to impose an internal trade border. The Northern Ireland protocol moves many of the checks which would have happened at the Irish land border to a new Irish Sea border.</p><p class="article__body-text">The protocol in effect keeps Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods and its customs union. That means that Northern Ireland still has to follow many EU rules that the rest of the UK does not. British civil servants perform checks on goods at Northern Ireland's ports and airports, monitored by officials from the EU. But it is a one-way border. Northern Irish firms retain almost unfettered access to the rest of the UK, leaving the province with a foot in two camps, which is an advantage to some businesses based there. However, goods coming into Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK are now treated as though coming from a foreign country. <a href="./counting-the-cost-of-brexits-impact-on-trade.html">Red tape</a>—from customs declarations to export health certificates and phytosanitary certificates (to stop pests and plant diseases from spreading)—has led many <a href="./a-border-inside-the-uk-brings-northern-ireland-closer-to-the-republic.html">British companies to stop selling</a> to Northern Ireland.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It has also led to empty shelves in Northern Ireland (after some supermarkets stopped sending hundreds of items from Britain), a ban on British soil coming to Northern Ireland and an insistence that dogs and cats travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland have rabies vaccinations, even though there is no rabies in domestic animals in the British Isles. The protocol has helped soothe nationalist anger at Brexit (56% of Northern Ireland’s voters wanted to remain in the EU). But many unionists now feel they are being pushed further from Britain. By creating barriers to buying British products (services are not covered by the protocol) it is becoming easier to buy from Ljubljana than from London. </p><p class="article__body-text">Last month border checks at Northern Ireland’s ports were halted after loyalists threatened inspectors. The main loyalist paramilitary groups—responsible for hundreds of often gruesome sectarian murders of Catholics during the Troubles—have withdrawn their support for the Good Friday Agreement in protest of the new border. Although all the unionist political parties oppose the protocol, nationalist and centrist parties support it as the best way to maintain a delicate equilibrium. In 2024 Northern Ireland’s devolved regional assembly will for the first time get to vote on whether to keep the protocol (Stormont was given no say when it was implemented). With elections due in 2022, unionist parties are six seats short of a majority. Even if they eventually vote down the deal, there is no guarantee that the Irish Sea border will be removed. Once in place, borders have a habit of hanging around. The Irish border was itself envisaged as a temporary measure. This year marks its centenary.</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Why%20is%20the%20Northern%20Ireland%20protocol%20so%20contentious%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-03-10&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F7k902g5s1m9ci8pdi5tf3i0f8ib397m8&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
