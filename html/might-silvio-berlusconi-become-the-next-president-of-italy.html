On the cover was a photograph of the former prime minister, his arms raised high to acknowledge the adulation of an unseen crowd. The booklet, modestly entitled “I am Forza Italia” (“Come on, Italy”, the party that Mr Berlusconi founded and leads), was the opening gambit in the 85-year-old media mogul’s undeclared campaign to crown his turbulent career with election, by a college of parliamentarians, to Italy’s highest office. The term of the incumbent president, Sergio Mattarella, expires on February 3rd, and he has repeatedly ruled out an extension. The race to succeed him is now dominating Italian public life.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/might-silvio-berlusconi-become-the-next-president-of-italy.mp3" title="Might Silvio Berlusconi become the next president of Italy?"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Why? A president spends much of his time making speeches, conferring honours and receiving dignitaries. He (there has never been a female president) has some weighty powers, including responsibility for dissolving parliament and appointing the prime minister. But those powers are few. What makes the choice of a president so important just now is that those who are thought to covet the job include the current prime minister, Mario Draghi, the guarantor to Brussels and the markets that Italy will spend productively the €200bn ($225bn) it stands to get from the <small>EU</small>’s pandemic recovery fund.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Whichever way the presidency goes could create a problem. If Mr Draghi is seen to fail in a bid to be chosen as the next occupant of the Quirinale palace, his standing will be diminished and thus his capacity to hold together the broad coalition of parties that support him but whose only common denominator is awe-struck respect for him. If, however, he succeeds, a replacement will need to be found who can stop the heterogeneous coalition from falling apart. And that will not be at all easy.</p><p class="article__body-text">Either way, the odds on a snap election will shorten, and if an early vote is held, the polls currently suggest that the outcome would be a coalition government dominated by two parties with a track record of confrontation with the European Commission: the Brothers of Italy party, whose roots lie in neo-fascism, and the populist Northern League. Within Italy, the risks of that tend to be downplayed. Not so elsewhere. Teneo, a consultancy, warned recently that Mr Draghi’s elevation could “plunge the country back into political turmoil, undermining efforts to enact reforms needed to secure regular instalments of recovery fund cash”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers and Matteo Salvini of the League are both nominally supportive of their ally, Mr Berlusconi. But it is clear their interests actually lie in ushering Mr Draghi upstairs. Whether he, and they, will get their way is another matter: a solution that allows Mr Draghi to stay on as prime minister with minimal loss of face may yet be found. Enrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic Party, which has risen to the top of the polls in recent weeks, wants Mr Draghi to stick around. And recent utterances by leading figures in the Five Star Movement, still the biggest group in parliament despite its collapse in the polls since the previous election, suggest that they do, too.</p><p class="article__body-text">Perhaps most important of all is the instinct for self-preservation, both political and financial, of Italy’s lawmakers. Because of a reform in 2019, the next parliament will have around two-thirds the number of seats of the current one. And if the next election is held before September 24th 2022, the first-time parliamentarians among them will lose their rights to a pension. Not for nothing is Mr Berlusconi implying that, were he made president, he would ensure the legislature ran to the end of its term in 2023. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "Guess who?"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Might%20Silvio%20Berlusconi%20become%20the%20next%20president%20of%20Italy%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F5sbs5u3155gl08nt9ma0qsljtlm0l2de&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
