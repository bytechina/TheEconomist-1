The latest is unusual. By using his position as an <small>MP</small> to advance the interests of extra-parliamentary paymasters, Owen Paterson, a patrician Tory, broke the rules. That is agreed by most, even among those who argue the investigation was mishandled. Yet by drawing attention to the fact that <small>MP</small>s may have second jobs, his case threatens to pull the whole system down.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/voters-do-not-want-mps-to-profit-from-their-job.mp3" title="Voters do not want MPs to profit from their job"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The problem is that the rules are out of step with public opinion. Parliamentarians are allowed to profit from their position, including by acting as consultants to firms looking for political advice, so long as they declare the income received and do not lobby, as Mr Paterson did. A fifth of <small>MP</small>s have a second job (defined as one which pays regular wages) and two-fifths declare income from some form of extra-parliamentary work. According to a poll by YouGov, 63% of Britons believe no such work should be allowed—let alone jobs that trade on insider knowledge.</p><p class="article__body-text">Chief among the <small>MP</small>s now in the spotlight is Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former attorney-general, who has been reported to the Committee on Standards in Public Life (<small>CSPL</small>), a watchdog, for defending the British Virgin Islands in a corruption inquiry, apparently from his Westminster office. Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative <small>MP</small>, has attracted attention because of his work for a mining firm while acting as trade envoy to Mongolia. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, has a job at a firm making alcohol-free hand sanitiser—and chaired a task force that recommended clarifying the covid-19 rules on hand sanitiser.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">A study published in 2015 found that voters were more sympathetic to work that paid less, of which there is plenty. In the register of members’ financial interests, it is revealed that Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, received £1,356 ($1,820) for serving as an assistant referee at a Europa League football match between Shakhtar Donetsk and Benfica. Dean Russell, a Tory <small>MP</small>, was paid £750 by Gareth Bacon, a colleague, for a painting. Three <small>MP</small>s earned £960 performing on stage in a “parliamentary rock band” called <small>MP4</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">With exceptions—such as Rosena Allin-Khan, a Labour shadow minister who works shifts as a doctor, and Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Tory <small>MP</small> and farmer—few <small>MP</small>s have jobs entirely unrelated to politics. Other than fees for media appearances, the most common sources of income involve selling access in ways big and small. Formerly, Labour <small>MP</small>s received trade-union sponsorships and Tories company directorships. But the former dried up in the 1990s, meaning it is Tories who are now more likely to top up their salaries.</p><p class="article__body-text">Today these activities are outnumbered by a more mundane way of selling insights: filling in surveys. In the most recent register, some 110 <small>MP</small>s declared that they did so, with both parties well represented. These are run by pollsters and commissioned by firms, charities and even other bits of the public sector, and pay <small>MP</small>s to respond. YouGov once described them as a way to find out “what Westminster thinks”. In reality, they are a way to find out what no-mark <small>MP</small>s think; few big names participate. In the recent register, Philip Davies, a Tory backbencher, reports that he spent 12 hours form-filling for a total of £1,525.</p><p class="article__body-text">Research finds that <small>MP</small>s in safe seats are most likely to take up part-time work. They may soon have fewer options. The <small>CSPL</small> is due to suggest changes to the rules, and the speaker of the House of Commons is expected to back them. One senior Tory <small>MP</small> predicts a tighter definition of what constitutes lobbying, and a ban on jobs where that is the principal purpose. <small>MP</small>s would still have to agree to the changes, but, as he notes, “it is a difficult one to tell your constituents you voted against.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Spiralling scandal"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Voters%20do%20not%20want%20MPs%20to%20profit%20from%20their%20job&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fr0uc8pjbsqog1qpo9g62uqigs2jcf33c&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
