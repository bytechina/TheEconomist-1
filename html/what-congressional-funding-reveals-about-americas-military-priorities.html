The National Defence Authorisation Act (<small>NDAA</small>)—the annual defence-policy bill and one of the few routine, bipartisan pieces of legislation—has followed a familiar pattern. After months of delays in which one of the largest budget categories, was pushed to the back burner in favour of other Democratic priorities, the Senate seemed to abandon efforts to pass the $768bn defence bill (which includes $147bn to buy new hardware) for the 2022 fiscal year. Leaders from both parties eventually compromised and the law passed the House this week. Amid the scramble it was easy to overlook what members of Congress think the mammoth defence budget should actually be for. Following the money reveals where lawmakers think America’s defence priorities lie.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/what-congressional-funding-reveals-about-americas-military-priorities.mp3" title="What Congressional funding reveals about America’s military priorities"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">From a distance, the budget appears to be guided by a strengthening bipartisan consensus that America must confront China and spend more to do so. Look closer, and disagreements abound. Exactly how the country should compete with its Pacific rival divides both parties. Even as America embarks on a new contest in Asia, lawmakers do not agree with one another, or with President Joe Biden, over how to address other pressing issues, most prominently a revanchist Russia. Nor have they proved capable of either ending the war on terror or voting to continue it.</p><p class="article__body-text">The current Congress’s free-spending habits are bipartisan when it comes to security. Mr Biden’s proposed defence budget, released in May, entailed only a modest increase, an attempt to placate doves on his left flank. But the rest of the legislature was not pleased. Both chambers added $25bn to the president’s proposal. The total package is now the largest in a decade, the result of a rising anxiety on both sides of the aisle in Congress that America is losing its military advantage, particularly on the high seas.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">For America’s armed forces, matching their Chinese competitors requires shedding older weapons platforms in favour of those at the cutting-edge, such as unmanned ships. Lawmakers have long been sceptical of this move to “divest to invest”, in Pentagon jargon. Bryan Clark of the Hudson Institute, a think-tank, suggests this scepticism is reasonable. “They feel the military has gone down this road multiple times of saying the next thing is so much better, but then it never arrives.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Following that logic, Congress is handing the Pentagon substantially more money to buy proven designs and strengthen America’s presence in the Pacific. Besides securing 13 new ships, including three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and two Virginia-class submarines, the law would authorise procurement of 347 aircraft, well above the Pentagon’s initial request for 290. This builds on a clear preference for the navy and air force dating to the end of the Obama administration, with spending on the former growing by 62% since the 2015 fiscal year. That, paired with $7bn for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, a fund to bolster regional allies, is a measure of Congress’s interest in a robust military response to rising Chinese power in Asia.</p><p class="article__body-text">Beneath this consensus, however, lie disagreements. Increased defence spending is opposed by the progressive left and libertarian right, which favour diplomacy, echoing the inclination toward <a href="./21806660.html">restraint in foreign policy</a> that is finding wider purchase in Washington. The <small>US</small> Innovation and Competition Act, an industrial-policy bill framed in anti-China terms and championed by the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, was kept separate from the defence bill after opposition from some Republicans, who spied a new form of corporate welfare. An effort to prohibit trade in goods made from slave labour in China’s Xinjiang region was met with quiet resistance from the White House and helped derail negotiations in the Senate, only to be left out of the compromise bill.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">And while Congress is keen to spend money on new kit, members are less enthusiastic about making the difficult decisions necessary to rebalance the armed forces and put them on a sound fiscal footing. Seamus Daniels of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank, finds that personnel costs account for nearly a third of the Pentagon’s budget, a figure that keeps rising despite America fielding the fewest troops in decades. These obligations to current and retired warriors (who cost more due to health-care expenses) crowd out funds for new weapons and research, but Congress is loath to tackle such a politically sensitive issue. Even as lawmakers push funding towards new systems, they show little appetite to give up on ageing ones, such as the Ticonderoga-class cruisers, creating an ongoing drain on scarce resources. “If Congress were to let divestments happen, the air force could acquire everything they wanted without increasing the budget at all,” says Travis Sharp of the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.</p><p class="article__body-text">Though Mr Biden would like to concentrate on China, Congress has other ideas. While the president attempts to both reassure European allies and cool tensions with Russia, lawmakers have taken a more maximalist approach. The defence bill allocates $4bn for European defence, as well as $300m for Ukraine’s armed forces, both greater sums than the president requested. While many legislators in both parties have supported sanctions on firms affiliated with Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Republicans proposed an amendment that would have overridden Mr Biden’s waiver of current sanctions, forcing Democrats to take a difficult vote. The measure did not make the final text.</p><p class="article__body-text">Politics also complicates efforts to tackle the lingering costs of the war on terror. The bill would require the air force to continue acquisitions of the <small>MQ</small>-9 Reaper, a drone platform used for counter-terrorism operations but derided by the air force brass as expensive and vulnerable in a great-power conflict. Despite America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and reduced footprint in the Middle East, Congress has kept funding for the army largely intact. Though a broad bipartisan group of senators promoted a repeal of the redundant 2002 Authorisation for the Use of Military Force against Iraq, the measure was left out. The bill also reaffirms the long-standing provision barring the president from transferring Guantánamo detainees to courts on the American mainland, ensuring the prison will remain open.</p><p class="article__body-text">Despite, or perhaps because of, the broad support for defence spending, hundreds of amendments were offered in both chambers of Congress, including many with only a tangential relationship to defence. “It’s becoming a vehicle for everyone’s legislation,” says Mr Clark. After passing the bill, Congress still needs to appropriate the funds it has authorised in the <small>NDAA</small>. The secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, warned lawmakers in a public statement that a failure to do so promptly would be catastrophic. Having run up a big bill, Congress still has to settle it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America, <a href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Money for something"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=What%20Congressional%20funding%20reveals%20about%20America%E2%80%99s%20military%20priorities&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F466m56n126jee3uqkli1okktovb6nsqc&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
