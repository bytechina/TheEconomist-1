On May 23rd, 488 days after his own swearing-in, President Joe Biden tried to reverse some of the damage by <a href="./joe-biden-has-big-plans-for-his-first-presidential-trip-to-asia.html">unveiling a new pact</a>, the 13-country Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (<small>ipef</small>). That Mr Biden took so much longer to launch his Asian trade policy illustrates one basic truth: it is far easier to tear up agreements than it is to craft them anew.</p><p class="article__body-text">Inevitably, one way to look at the <small>ipef</small> is by way of comparison to the <small>tpp</small> (which lives on in reduced form, absent America). Some bits sound rather familiar. One selling-point for the <small>tpp</small> was that it was a “21st-century trade agreement” complete with high standards for workers’ rights and e-commerce rules. The <small>ipef</small> is also “a 21st-century economic arrangement”, according to Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser. The original <small>tpp</small> members accounted for nearly 40% of global <small>gdp</small>, roughly the same share as the current <small>ipef</small> partners. Most crucially, China is still excluded. The <small>ipef</small>, like the <small>tpp</small>, is an attempt to build a trading structure in Asia that enshrines both America’s economic principles and its economic power—welcomed by many in the region as a counterbalance to China’s heft.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">That, however, is where the similarities end. Mr Trump’s success in winning support with his calls to stop countries “ripping off” America has made many in Washington leery of ambitious free-trade deals. So rather than starting work on a pact that would require approval from Congress, Mr Biden’s team has designed a framework that is more malleable and may avoid that political death-trap. In announcing the launch, Katherine Tai, the United States Trade Representative (<small>ustr</small>), pledged to “keep Congress close” in shaping the <small>ipef</small>—a far cry from putting it to a vote.</p><p class="article__body-text">Malleability has a few big downsides. It limits what America can offer. A cut in tariff rates, a plank of most free-trade deals, is a non-starter because it would require congressional support. America still vows to push for strong labour and environmental standards but, unable to offer more access to its vast market, it lacks a key bargaining chip. The durability of the <small>ipef</small> is also in doubt. Were Mr Trump to return to the Oval Office in 2024, he would not need three days to ditch the framework.</p><p class="article__body-text">The Biden administration has tried to make a virtue of these limits. Rather than conceiving of the <small>ipef</small> as a conventional deal, it has declared that the pact will rest on four pillars, with trade promotion just one. The other three goals are to make supply chains more resilient; to promote infrastructure investment and clean energy; and to form new rules on taxation and anti-corruption. It is tempting to dismiss such a wide-ranging agenda as too vague to amount to anything. But paradoxically, a near-stumble at the launch of the framework illustrated that it could, in theory, have force to its contents: America had to tone down the language in its founding documents, otherwise some in Asia would have balked at signing them.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Matthew Goodman of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank, notes that the focus on topics such as digital trade, competition policy and bribery makes for a good menu for the <small>ipef</small>. “These are issues that are very much in the interest of our partners in the region,” he says. At the same time, breadth poses a challenge. Instead of just having the <small>ustr</small> as the lead negotiator, as in normal trade talks, the Commerce Department is in charge of the non-trade portfolio. That risks turning it into a multi-headed beast.</p><p class="article__body-text">For now, many in the region are most pleased by the symbolism. The wounds from America’s <small>tpp</small> exit are still raw. Since Mr Biden’s election victory, allies have waited and waited for America to devise a new Asian trade strategy. At last it has arrived, even if it is more notable for its political constraints than its economic potential. “We are just happy to have them at the table,” says one Australian official. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For more coverage of Joe Biden’s presidency, visit our <a href="./president-joe-biden.html">dedicated hub</a> and follow along as we track shifts in his <a href="https://econ.st/3BCgX9s">approval rating</a>.
