Painted in the Netherlands in 1885, it is as far in tone as could be imagined from the blazing sunflowers of his later work in the south of France. Five members of a farming household huddle round the table, sharing a meal of potatoes and coffee. The mood is cramped, the colours mostly muted greens and browns. Outside the circle of lamplight the dark presses in. It was one of the few group scenes he painted, and nearly everyone who saw it in his lifetime hated it. Van Gogh told his sister that it was the best thing he’d ever done.</p><p class="article__body-text">This autumn the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam has made it the focus of an exhibition, under the rubric “Mistake or Masterpiece?” The title is a bit of a tease, but Bregje Gerritse, who curated the show, says viewers should take the question seriously. The painting is marred by errors: funny torsos, gazes that fail to meet. Some may be intentional, but Van Gogh acknowledged others were bloopers. Still, he thought his critics missed the point. With “The Potato Eaters” he was reaching for a new authenticity, an appreciation of misshapen beauty that refused to romanticise its subjects.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It started with a deadline. Van Gogh’s brother Theo, an art dealer in Paris, wrote in February 1885 to ask whether he had anything for that year’s salon. Vincent was living in Brabant, in the southern Netherlands, drawing the local farmers. He had nothing suitable, but threw himself into the project. Van Gogh greatly admired Jean-François Millet’s depictions of rural life and was influenced by Jozef Israels, a Dutch painter of working-class scenes. He was also studying colour theory and physiognomy, the pseudoscience of reading character from facial structure. But most of all he was obsessed with the farmers. He wanted to capture their rough bodies and their honest relationship to the earth.</p><p class="article__body-text">His drawings from the period, the jagged lines already recognisably his own, are full of hunched shoulders and angular tree limbs. He sought out “raw, flat faces with low foreheads and thick lips”. He seems transfixed by one model’s protruding jaw. When the flesh tones in his first go at “The Potato Eaters” came out too light he shifted to “soapy” hues, “about the colour of a good dusty potato, unpeeled of course”.</p><p class="article__body-text">The Dutch have a genius for this sort of thing: celebrating the ordinary, often with a nose-thumbing defiance. You can look back from Van Gogh to the Old Masters, with their minute attention to cheese, pets and drinking games at the expense of gods and saints. This is what Pieter Bruegel displays in his “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus”: the farmer going about his ploughing, unperturbed by the tragedy. You can also look ahead from Van Gogh to the simple, repetitive forms of Piet Mondrian or, in architecture, the geometric concrete of Rem Koolhaas.</p><p class="article__body-text">In film the Netherlands’ gift is for documentaries rather than fiction. In television it is for long interviews and reality programmes, where the Dutch series “Big Brother” played a pioneering role. One of the innovators was Theo van Gogh, the artist’s great-grandnephew, a provocative reality-<small>TV</small> innovator who was murdered by an Islamist extremist in 2004. The best Dutch literature swims in everyday tedium, from “The Evenings” (1947), Gerard Reve’s novel of queer post-war ennui, to “The Discomfort of Evening” (2020), Marieke Lucas Rijneveld’s novel of queer millennial ennui. “The Potato Eaters” could have been used as a cover illustration for that recent book, which opens with a meal in a poor Christian farmhouse in Brabant, about 115 years on.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The painting wound up hanging over the fireplace of Van Gogh’s brother. Anton van Rappard, a fellow painter, criticised its formal deficiencies so harshly that Van Gogh’s friendship with him never recovered. The next year he moved to France and discovered the Impressionists, and his palette exploded into the kaleidoscope familiar from his later work. Though Van Gogh may not have intended it, that contrast makes “The Potato Eaters” feel like a judgment on the cramped moralism of Dutch society. The refreshing Dutch embrace of the ordinary goes along with a sometimes oppressive conformism. The country’s unofficial slogan is <em>doe normaal</em>: “don’t be egotistical, act normally”. Yet its greatest geniuses, including Van Gogh, have been those who couldn’t. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline "Earthy delights"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20Van%20Gogh%20Museum%20showcases%20a%20rejected%20early%20masterpiece&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-30&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F4c5ukhtheq7d1o60rbr74luqgdcbrq77&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
