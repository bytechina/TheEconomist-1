Always a black felt-tip. It looked purposeful, as if he meant to take notes. In fact, it was to stop well-wishers trying to shake his hand. Every day he went through the ritual of pushing the pen between his right thumb and forefinger, then folding the other fingers round the shaft. All with his left hand, which just about worked. His right hand and arm could do nothing at all. Not after that day in Italy in 1945 when, as a young lieutenant, he had been told to take Hill 913 and German fire had smashed his shoulder away.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/bob-dole-believed-in-hard-work-not-words.mp3" title="Bob Dole believed in hard work, not words"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">For some time he was completely paralysed. Over months and years he worked and worked until the dead arm was his only visible handicap. Yet this meant he could not lace up shoes, cut up his food, put in eye drops or button a jacket. It was hard to turn pages, and impossible to hold both a mike and a script. Frustration sharpened the edge of his dry, terse Kansan tongue. That could lead to political suicide, as when in a <small>TV</small> debate in 1976 he called all the conflicts of the 20th century “Democrat wars”. He truly went for the jugular then, and it was his own.</p><p class="article__body-text">His injuries, though, also propelled him towards becoming at many points the most powerful Republican in the land. Since he didn’t want to end up on the street selling pencils, he started reading. That got him into law school, then into politics. For 35 years from 1961 he served in Congress, 27 of them in the Zoo, as he called the Senate, and 11 of those as ranking Republican leader. He was also chairman of the Finance Committee, the guy who could arrange the quid pro quos for the long line of lobbyists who came to his door. Pen in hand, he would ask them in—with an accommodating smile for the agribusinesses that grew like Topsy all over the Sunflower State.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The role of dealmaker was ideal for him. His three years of recuperation in an army hospital had taught him infinite patience. He could wait for weeks, tanning himself on the balcony outside his office, sipping chocolate milkshakes in the Senate Dining Room, until the time was right to make a move. Then someone would give way, and the deal was struck. Since he could not take notes he listened intently, his face settling into that dark scowl that earned him the nicknames Mr Grumpy and Mr Gridlock. Yet he also cut deals with Democrats—on Social Security, food stamps and the law he took most pride in, the Americans with Disabilities Act. His energetic campaigns for veterans united everyone. He often broke the tension, too, with one of his zinger jokes. And though he mocked President Jimmy Carter as “chicken-fried McGovern”, he even came to respect McGovern, after a while.</p><p class="article__body-text">Three times he ran for president himself, and three times failed. (The closest attempt was in 1996, against Bill Clinton. Twice he did not get as far as nomination.) The question that dogged him was what his vision was. He couldn’t say, and wouldn’t be scripted either. When some fool asked him what single thing people should know about him, he replied “Beats me.” He just hoped to serve the country. If the media didn’t like one vision, he told them, he could easily find another in his vision-of-the-month club. That joke didn’t go down too well.</p><p class="article__body-text">He was plainly conservative, a foreign-policy hawk who disliked labour laws, environmental protection, over-regulation and extravagant social services. But he had mostly become a Republican because he was a doer, and without being red you could do nothing in Kansas. Certainly he was no radical. Supply-side economics, with its tax cuts for the rich, struck him as garbage. (The good news he’d heard was that a busload of supply-siders went over a cliff, and everyone was killed. The bad news was that two seats were empty.) The guiding principle of his politics was that governments should not run deficits. For years he refused to sign a no-tax-increase pledge, until it was clear that his party would not back him unless he did.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">He had not learned such parsimony in Washington. He had learned it in Kansas in the 1930s, when dust-clouds turned the sky dark-brown round his tiny town of Russell, in the Plains. The farms disappeared that fed the creamery where his father worked, and his mother had to sell sewing machines door-to-door. As for him, he became a soda jerk in Dawson’s drugstore, and could flip a scoop of ice cream up to the ceiling to catch it in a glass. That was before the war came, and Hill 913.</p><p class="article__body-text">Russell was the real vision he carried in his head. This was an America that was not some myth from a golden past. He had known it personally. The virtues prized there were honesty, frugality, faith and, above all, dogged perseverance. He trusted in the hard way. The reason he became Richard Nixon’s hatchet man during Watergate, fighting off his attackers, was not just because he considered the president a mentor and a friend. It was because Nixon, though hardly honest, was a poor grocer’s son who had risen through sheer determination. At the president’s funeral he pictured him as a boy lying in bed, listening to the whistle of night trains bound for distant places. That image seemed to apply more to Russell than to Yorba Linda, California.</p><p class="article__body-text">In 1996 he went back home to celebrate gaining the nomination. It was half a century since he had thumped face-down in the dirt, trying to spit the blood out of his mouth, and found he could feel nothing below his neck. At the old house on Maple Street the pulley-and-weights contraption his father had built, to help him strengthen his arms, was still on the wall of the garage.</p><p class="article__body-text">In his right hand, too, he still clutched his pen. Black felt-tip, with slight toothmarks. He wanted it buried with him. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Obituary section of the print edition under the headline "Climbing that hill"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Bob%20Dole%20believed%20in%20hard%20work%2C%20not%20words&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-09&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fgl559f1e35brnpgn1urv8ncacr80uuua&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
