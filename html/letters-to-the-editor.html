These were not protesters. These were occupiers who said they would not leave until their demands were met. You said the police already had ample powers to quell the disorder, and yet it took two court injunctions to stop the incessant air horns and honking. The police had to deal with a core group showing utter disregard for the rights of Ottawa’s residents to enjoy their homes. Invoking the Emergencies Act was necessary to remove them.</p><p class="article__body-text">This was more than a question of free speech. We were dealing with a group of well-funded bullies. This was not a regular protest. This was something else.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>MADELEINE CôTE</small><br/><em>Gatineau, Canada</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220129_cud001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220129_cud001.jpg" srcset="../image/20220129_cud001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Processing language</h2><p class="article__body-text">Johnson’s column on losing native languages was outstanding (<a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/29/losing-native-languages-is-painful-but-they-can-be-recovered">January 29th</a>). It is true that a multilingual person’s “first language is the one most imbued with emotions.” Our “mother tongue” seems to be stored in both the procedural (more emotionally based) and explicit (or verbal) parts of our brains. Subsequent languages have fewer connections to procedural memory, where neurons are fully myelinated at birth, in contrast with those of explicit memory, which are myelinated during the first three years of life.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ribot’s law refers to the clinical finding that people with brain dysfunction may have their first language skills preserved intact. In 1843, Jacques Lordat described a priest from Languedoc whose brain damage created profound language deficits, but only in French, his second language. His native Occitan was unaffected.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Such clinical findings offer a fascinating window into the way our brains process language. In his book on aphasia, Sigmund Freud made the controversial but now generally accepted claim that language is processed in multiple brain regions.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>RICHARD WAUGAMAN</small><br/>Clinical professor of psychiatry<br/>Georgetown University<br/><em>Washington,</em> <small>DC</small></p><p class="article__body-text">I found Johnson’s essay both insightful and moving. It made me reflect on my personal journey, growing up in America but speaking only Cantonese until the age of six. Since my mother never spoke English, I was able to keep up with my Cantonese. In 1980, at the age of 31, I went to Hong Kong for the first time to set up my cookery classes there for foreigners who wanted to learn about Chinese cuisine. Being in Hong Kong was a déjà vu experience, as I recognised the streets from Chinese movies I had watched as a child. I was also delighted to find everyone speaking Cantonese and looking like me. My first <small>TV</small> series for the <small>BBC</small> included many clips from Hong Kong. I still love hearing Cantonese, whether on film or in music. Being bilingual has greatly enriched my life and made for a surprising career.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>KEN HOM</small><br/>Chef and author<br/><em>Bangkok</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220205_eup004.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220205_eup004.jpg" srcset="../image/20220205_eup004.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>A Russian precedent</h2><p class="article__body-text">I read your article on the situation in Narva, a town in Estonia close to the border with Russia (“<a href="./as-russia-menaces-ukraine-eastern-european-countries-grow-nervous.html">Who’s next?</a>”, February 5th). Today’s 80% ethnic Russian majority is not the result of a “legacy” of Narva belonging to the Russian empire and then to the Soviet Union. In fact, at the end of the 1930s the overwhelming majority of Narva’s inhabitants were ethnically Estonian. The demographic change was made first in 1944 by Soviet carpet bombing that destroyed 95% of buildings and forced survivors to flee. The Soviets then did not allow Estonian citizens to return to their hometown, which had become part of a new Soviet military uranium mining complex.</p><p class="article__body-text">Native Estonians were not considered trustworthy to live in that area. They were replaced by people resettled from the Soviet Union. Today’s Russian majority was created by local ethnic cleansing.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>TUNNE KELAM</small><br/><em>Tallinn, Estonia</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220205_brp003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220205_brp003.jpg" srcset="../image/20220205_brp003.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Spreading across the country</h2><p class="article__body-text">I read your report on the British government’s findings into “levelling up” (<a href="./the-british-governments-levelling-up-plans-are-oddly-old-fashioned.html">“Spreading the jam”</a>, February 5th). In our London household we have colleagues who have left the city and are based in places as diverse as Devon, Hampshire, Lincoln and Nottingham, all earning salaries which would put them among the highest earners in those places.</p><p class="article__body-text">Unfortunately this government appears to view working from home more as an occasion for sloth and indolence than for distributing opportunity equitably across the country. The debate on levels of regional spending may be valid, but it is far easier to believe that levelling up will be advanced by expanding access to well-paid jobs to anybody with an internet connection.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>JAMES OSBORNE</small><br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220205_map501.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220205_map501.jpg" srcset="../image/20220205_map501.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Uganda’s oil projects</h2><p class="article__body-text">With regard to the development of oil projects in Uganda, you state that “land acquisition is always messy, and politics brutal” (“<a href="economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/02/05/a-big-ugandan-oil-project-is-progressing-at-last">Pipe dreams</a>”, February 5th). The East African Crude Oil Pipeline project proves it doesn’t have to be. Uganda’s stringent legal framework around land acquisition provides important protections for people affected by such projects. New homes, substantial allowances for disturbance and programmes to restore livelihoods are among the compensation packages offered that are above market rates.</p><p class="article__body-text">People receive an additional annual payment for each year of delay, along with the right to live on and farm their lands until total compensation is paid in full. Indeed, under Ugandan law it is impossible for someone to be relocated or development work commence until they have received compensation in full.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Such laws concerning land acquisition have not merely been created by government, or investors, but have been codified after full consultation with parliamentarians of all parties, local and international <small>NGO</small>s and the affected communities themselves. There are some individuals and <small>NGO</small>s who are opposed to this opportunity for Uganda’s economic advancement through fossil fuels. But it is a mistake to believe loud voices mean they are numerous. The numbers speak for themselves. The acceptance rate for compensation packages is over 97%.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>IRENE BATABE</small><br/>Permanent secretary<br/>Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development<br/><em>Kampala, Uganda</em></p><h2>Sexy Gordon Brown</h2><p class="article__body-text">Bagehot described Gordon Brown, a former British prime minister, as “dour” (<a href="./boris-johnson-is-making-boring-politics-look-attractive.html">January 29th</a>).
