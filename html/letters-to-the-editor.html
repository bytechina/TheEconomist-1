Few data are available on the quality of death and we mostly rely on the doctor to self-report. The Dutch, world experts on assisted dying, are clear that the procedure can fail and requires a euthanasia “rescue”. We have no useful data on drug safety. Using death as the sole endpoint is like claiming a successful drug cure for baldness but ignoring the vomiting and seizures. Doctors will be expected to prescribe untested drugs.</p><p class="article__body-text">Increasing numbers of abuses are appearing. In one Dutch euthanasia clinic, requests for an assisted death were more likely to come from single women with a lower educational background, a depressive disorder and a history of sexual abuse.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Moreover, palliative care does not flourish with assisted dying. The Belgian and Dutch growth in all palliative-care services has stalled since 2012. As for public support, a recent survey found that 42% of the public in Britain thought assisted dying meant refusing or stopping life-sustaining treatment, which are already legal in the country; 10% thought assisted dying was hospice-type care. Less than half understood it was about giving lethal doses of drugs to end life.</p><p class="article__body-text">Assisted dying is no panacea and will not stop bad deaths, especially when 118,000 people every year in Britain fail to get the palliative care they desperately need. That is the real scandal.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>CLAUD REGNARD</small><br/>Honorary consultant in palliative medicine<br/>St Oswald’s Hospice<br/><em>Newcastle-upon-Tyne</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>AMY PROFFITT</small><br/>President<br/>Association for Palliative Medicine<br/><em>Fareham, Hampshire</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ROB GEORGE</small><br/>Professor of palliative care<br/>King’s College London</p><p class="article__body-text">Comprehensive Dutch surveys have disclosed that thousands of patients have been given lethal injections without an explicit request, and that thousands of cases have gone unreported, both in flagrant violation of the legal “safeguards”. Five years ago the government proposed a further relaxation: assisted suicide for old people who think their life is “completed”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Abuse and the slippery slope are the realities. Indeed, the reality of the slope is inherent in the very case you make for legalisation. If the guiding principle is “that individuals are entitled to choose how they end their lives”, why not give any competent person who wants to be killed, whether sick and dying or young and healthy, a lethal injection?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>PROFESSOR JOHN KEOWN</small><br/>Kennedy Institute of Ethics<br/>Georgetown University<br/><em>Washington,</em> <small>DC</small></p><p class="article__body-text">As the technological capacity to manipulate our human condition increases so must our appreciation of life’s variety and possibilities. Developments in pre-natal testing for Down’s syndrome have led to no Down’s births in some European countries for a number of years. Parents who wish to continue a pregnancy following a positive test are viewed, more or less covertly by medical practitioners, and overtly by Richard Dawkins, as irresponsible and deviant. Yet I remember my experience, while at Cambridge, of working with Down’s syndrome people who revealed a great deal about what it meant to be fully human in ways that the university did not.</p><p class="article__body-text">Having kept company as a priest with many people after a terminal diagnosis I have discovered the tremendous surprise of life-enhancing experiences, both for patients themselves and lastingly for those who love them, in precisely those places where control over our lives breaks down. If we are to legalise assisted dying it must be within a genuinely mixed system in which religious conviction (whatever we understand by that slippery term) is not viewed with patronising derision. Beyond our mental and technical control, as Hamlet told Horatio, lie undreamed things; the cracks Leonard Cohen sang about where the light breaks in.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>REV.

If the living cannot be guaranteed protection, what hope is there for the dying? You offered the defence that no apparent abuses of euthanasia have occurred in countries where it is legal. But there is always governmental mission creep. The global population of people aged 60 and over will more than double by 2050. What greater incentive will governments have for seeking the easy way out for costly pensioners?</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>HENRY HARINGTON</small><br/><em>Luccombe, Somerset</em></p><p class="article__body-text">My wife was racked with a fatal disease that stripped her muscles of their ability to function but left her mind intact. When she could no longer do enough of the things that gave her life meaning, her only legal option was to stop eating and drinking. Despite the best hospice care, it took her 11 uncomfortable and painful days to die. Our pets normally have faster, painless deaths.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>RAYMOND SMITH</small><br/><em>New Paltz, New York</em></p><p class="article__body-text">Life, after all, is a terminal condition, and as such is “an unprofitable episode disturbing the blessed calm of non-existence” (Schopenhauer). As our birth, genetics and place are purely random we should all be allowed the certainty of the manner and timing of our own death. A truly civilised society based on rational thought would provide the opportunity and conditions to enable its citizens to exercise this choice.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>STEPHEN LACEY</small><br/><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/11/articles/body/20211113_eup505.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211113_eup505.jpg" srcset="../image/20211113_eup505.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>The wrong advice on covid-19</h2><p class="article__body-text">Regarding the low take up of the covid-19 vaccine in some parts of Europe (“<a href="./eastern-european-countries-are-being-hit-by-a-wave-of-covid-deaths.html">The arc of susceptibility</a>”, November 13th), I live in the south-eastern fringe of Bavaria, an affluent area with one of Germany‘s lowest inoculation rates and highest number of infections. Here, just like in eastern Europe, intensive-care units are chock-full. Alas, we can hardly blame official neglect or misinformation for our unwillingness to get jabbed. Rather, a peculiar penchant for feeble-minded quack-cures, typified by the exorbitant number of homeopaths offering their services, is to blame.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>CHRISTOPHER STEHBERGER</small><br/><em>Traunstein, Germany</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/11/articles/body/20211113_eup001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211113_eup001.jpg" srcset="../image/20211113_eup001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Trans-Europe espresso</h2><p class="article__body-text">“<a href="./how-trains-could-replace-planes-in-europe.html">Disoriented express</a>” (November 13th) reported on the difficulties of interconnected rail travel in Europe.
