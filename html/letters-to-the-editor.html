That view aligns with what Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s prime minister from 1959 to 1990 and, to my mind, one of the world’s greatest statesmen, predicted would happen to the two cities in his book, “One Man’s View of the World”, published in 2013. Even before the recent crackdowns by China’s Communist Party on civil and political liberties, which have undermined the rule of law and scared businesses away, Lee stressed that Hong Kong, now being a part of China, would grow ever closer to the mainland, with all the strains that come with that. As a result, it would become less attractive to global business and more like a regular Chinese city. </p><p class="article__body-text">By contrast, Singapore, being an independent country with a government dedicated to openness, anti-corruption and the rule of law, would grow ever more important to the region and for global business.

Above all, however, his divine mission must ‘prove’ itself…those who faithfully surrender to him must fare well.

But there is another particularly important issue that impedes reforms there: the widespread perception in the region that politics is inherently a zero-sum game. <br/><br/>The middle income status of most Latin American countries creates high and unmet expectations of how much better things should be. This, combined with the legacy of unsuccessful reforms to increase growth from the last 20 to 30 years, has resulted in a cynical perception by many Latin Americans that reforms are really about how to split the pie, never truly to grow it. Although not unique to the region, my impression is that it is more pervasive there then in almost anywhere else in the world and encourages interest groups to oppose reforms almost reflexively.<br/><br/>Paradoxically, a potential solution to this may be for politics to acknowledge openly the pie-splitting aspect of reforms. Outright stating that badly needed reforms will create some losers might help create a more healthy understanding about the short-term pain versus long-term gain of reforms, helping temper expectations. It would also lower the opposition from vested interests, especially if they receive some short-run compensation for their losses.<br/><br/><small>PEDRO FRANCO DE CAMPOS PINTO</small><br/>Assistant professor<br/>Musashi University<br/><i>Tokyo</i></p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220618_LDD002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220618_LDD002.jpg" srcset="../image/20220618_LDD002.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">In “<a href="./latin-americas-vicious-circle-is-a-warning-to-the-west.html">How democracies decay</a>” (June 18th) you state that “Latin America in turn needs to recognise that it has much to gain from rebuilding closer ties [with the West], and that its role in a world dominated by China would be that of a neo-colony”.<br/><br/>I fail to see, however, how this would be any different from how the Central American Free Trade Agreement subjugated poorer nations to raw goods production and manufacturing colonies of the United States.<br/><br/>So long as poorer Latin American states are hamstrung by anti-competitive, protectionist economic policy from the United States and others, the gap between educational promise and economic opportunity for younger Latin American generations will persist. Perhaps the spectre of Chinese intervention in Latin America will cause American politicians to re-assess their economic colonisation of their southern neighbours with more favourable terms. <br/><br/>I for one am not holding my breath.<br/><br/><small>NATHAN BYRD</small><br/><i>London</i></p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220625_WBD002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="720" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220625_WBD002.jpg" srcset="../image/20220625_WBD002.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><h2>In which we serve</h2><p class="article__body-text">Bartleby scoffed at the concept of the “servant leader” (<a href="./why-managers-deserve-more-understanding.html">June 25th</a>).

Intriguingly, one 19th-century Hebrew commentary reads this advice as a cynical ploy. Just tell the people you are there to serve them, and they will not stipulate any limitations or conditions at your coronation; eventually you’ll get all the power you want, having caught more <br/>flies with honey. </p><p class="article__body-text">I suspect many a manager would gladly subscribe to this rather devious version of servant leadership.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>shalom rosenfeld</small><br/><i>Silver Spring, Maryland</i></p><p class="article__body-text">The motto of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is “Serve to Lead”.
