Since then we have worked together to leverage ideas from that line of thinking paired with blockchain technology to explore the decentralised provision of public goods. One promising experiment has been Gitcoin’s use of matching funds to support a democratised crowdfunding platform in the Ethereum ecosystem, directing tens of millions of dollars so far with a minimal team.</p><p class="article__body-text">Experiments like this illustrate how fiscally big government need not imply administratively big government. Thus the need for greater public good as technology advances need not imply the growth of the administrative state.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>VITALIK BUTERIN</small><br/>Founder<br/>Ethereum<br/><em>The Ether</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>E. GLEN WEYL</small><br/>Founder<br/>RadicalxChange Foundation<br/><em>Kirkland, Washington</em></p><p class="article__body-text">A focus on state size as measured by government spending and taxation ignores the many ways in which the British state grew dramatically during the 1980s. The central government was more than willing to increase its power to engage in its own brand of social engineering. Local authorities had their control over education weakened by the introduction of the national curriculum. Their control over social housing was curtailed by right-to-buy legislation. Local budgets were increasingly subject to central-government control. Councils’ efforts to fight homophobia were crushed by the infamous Section 28.</p><p class="article__body-text">For the most economically marginalised in society, the state became a despotic Leviathan. In 1989 Paddy Ashdown wrote “Citizen’s Britain”, which discussed the paradox of a government that was supposedly committed to rolling back the frontiers of the state spending ever larger sums on social controls: police, prisons, punishment and surveillance. Ashdown saw the compulsory conscription of the poor into “training” or low-paid jobs as akin to the very methods that the Soviet Union was trying to move away from.</p><p class="article__body-text">Jo Grimond, in the foreword of Ashdown’s book, argued that Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet did not actually believe in small government, lower taxation, less regulation, the spread of wealth and power or competition. Thatcherism was little more than another form of corporatism.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>WILLIAM FRANCIS</small><br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211113_ldp001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211113_ldp001.jpg" srcset="../image/20211113_ldp001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Nuclear’s waste problem</h2><p class="article__body-text">As a low-carbon, reliable and generally safe baseload power source, nuclear energy may have a role in the transition away from fossil fuels (“<a href="./the-discreet-charm-of-nuclear-power.html">The discreet charm of nuclear power</a>”, November 13th). But let us not forget the main motivations for the current energy transition, namely climate change and depleting finite resources. This argument is entrenched in the Brundtland Commission’s definition of sustainable development from the 1980s, which is in effect not to oblige future generations to clean up our mess. This is precisely where nuclear power falls short. The long-term legacy waste issue is a negative environmental externality with potential economic and social consequences for our descendants of the same magnitude as climate change. The fact that these impacts, unlike climate change, are largely not yet felt today does not mean we should replace one problem with another.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">I am neither for nor against nuclear power, but I do strongly agree with you that all energy sources have their drawbacks and we must have the full picture in view when considering alternatives. Ernst Schumacher, on the other hand, was a strong opponent and would surely not approve of your misuse of his “small is beautiful”.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PROFESSOR RUSSELL MCKENNA</small><br/>Chair in energy transition<br/>University of Aberdeen</p><p class="article__body-text">Just operating most existing reactors costs more than energy efficiency or new renewables, which in 2020 became the cheapest bulk power source in 90% of the world. Existing American subsidies already rivalled nuclear construction costs. More billions or tens of billions of dollars in current new subsidies to distressed (or even to all) reactors only compounds the misallocation. It diverts even greater resources from more-climate-effective competitors that can’t contest market space or access grid capacity hogged by taxpayer-funded zombie reactors.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>AMORY B.

Jennifer Shahade wrote about this in “Chess Bitch”. Published in 2005 it offered a counter-example. In Georgia there are many strong female chess players, attributed to a culture in that country that encourages women to play the game.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>NELSON MINAR</small><br/><em>Grass Valley, California</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211113_ldp503.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211113_ldp503.jpg" srcset="../image/20211113_ldp503.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Aiding Afghanistan</h2><p class="article__body-text">Your call for the West to hold its nose, deal with the Taliban and ensure that the Afghan people do not starve this winter is absolutely correct (“<a href="./the-world-must-act-now-to-stop-afghans-starving.html">War, drought, famine</a>”, November 13th). If we have to abandon temporary hopes of human development, we can at least ensure that people survive to change things in the future. As for hypothecating aid to development, that weapon would be better directed at Pakistan.</p><p class="article__body-text">Once Britain’s and America’s single largest recipient of aid, this nuclear-armed state supported the Taliban over many years then directed the subversion of the Afghan government. Its actions should not be consequence-free and we should either remove all aid to Pakistan or demand the reasonable behaviour of the Taliban, Islamabad’s client in Kabul, as the condition for continuing aid.

It is, in fact, a dialectal variant, like the spelt/spelled variation that he discussed. If Johnson were to give himself the pleasure of reading Scottish law reports, he would find that “pled” is the long-established past tense of “plead” north of the River Tweed.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ALAN SIMCOCK</small><br/><em>London</em></p><p class="article__body-text">After I cut the weeds in my lawn with my Weedeater I asked my family what I had just done. “Weedeatered” didn’t sound right.
