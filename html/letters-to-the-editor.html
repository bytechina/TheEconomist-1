Non-human primates, from chimpanzees and gorillas to marmosets and macaques, all share many exquisite mental faculties with humans. Indeed, this is what makes non-human primates attractive to researchers. However, implanting machinery in their brains remains an undeniably brutal procedure that causes them to suffer immensely, as would humans.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">You said that Western countries will inevitably have to choose between accepting therapies produced from non-human primate brain experiments or rejecting them on principle. This is not a new problem, and the argument shortchanges ethical alternative methods that show promise of being superior to animal experiments. Moreover, the scientific literature is replete with duplicate and non-reproducible primate-brain studies that suggest the value of these experiments is less than the animal-research community claims.</p><p class="article__body-text">The important lesson will not be expressed in the firing neurons of tortured monkeys, but in finding ways to advance human health while also respecting the lives and rights of non-human primates.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>KEVIN SCHNEIDER</small><br/>Executive director<br/>Nonhuman Rights Project<br/><em>New York</em></p><p class="article__body-text">The United States actually does have a large colony of free-ranging macaques on the small and uninhabited Morgan Island off the coast of South Carolina. Known as Monkey Island to locals, its furry residents can be seen playing on the beach and swinging through dense foliage. The 4,000 or so breeding macaques originally came from Puerto Rico, where they arrived as stowaways from India.</p><p class="article__body-text">Recognising the need for a reliable source of primate specimens, the federal government rounded them up and deposited them on an island offered by South Carolina. The secretive place is closely patrolled by the coast guard, but the monkeys have the run of the land, free from all but occasional human interference to deposit food, and the removal of some specimens to the mainland for testing.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>MITCHELL JACKSON</small><br/><em>Greenville, South Carolina</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210731_asp002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20210731_asp002.jpg" srcset="../image/20210731_asp002.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Race relations in Singapore</h2><p class="article__body-text">Readers of “<a href="./racial-prejudice-rears-its-head-in-singapore.html">Imperfect harmony</a>” (July 31st) would not have guessed that Singapore was born as an independent country precisely because its leaders refused to countenance a political arrangement based on the dominance of one race. Having separated from Malay-majority Malaysia in 1965, the easiest path for Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues would have been to base their political legitimacy on the Chinese majority in Singapore. Rather, against the odds and with great courage, they insisted on building a multiracial polity.</p><p class="article__body-text">They chose English as the main language of government and education instead of Chinese. They gave every race, religion and language-group free scope to develop their heritages and cultures. Rather than enforce majority-Chinese dominance, they protected the rights of minorities. A Presidential Council of Minority Rights was empowered to veto any legislation that discriminated against any racial or religious community.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">At present, seven out of 20 cabinet ministers are minorities, as are the chief justice and nine out of 33 judges on the Supreme Court. Malays, Indians and Eurasians have occupied senior positions in all three branches of government, including in the armed and security forces.</p><p class="article__body-text">Our multiracial harmony remains a work in progress. As in many other multiracial societies, it is harder to be a racial minority in Singapore than a member of the majority race, and there remain group differences in social and economic achievement between ethnic groups. But all have progressed substantially year after year.</p><p class="article__body-text">By working unremittingly on our multiracial harmony, we have avoided the racial and religious strife that have troubled many other post-colonial nations, and for that matter, America and Britain too.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>T.K.

By the time disadvantaged students apply to university, it is often too late. This is crucial in mathematics, where a proven high capability is essential for science, technology and engineering degrees.</p><p class="article__body-text">Universities are taking matters into their own hands. Cambridge, Imperial, King’s, Durham and Exeter are among the universities founding mathematics schools, each educating hundreds of disadvantaged sixth-formers. But, as with Oxford's foundation year, scalability is limited. We can lean harder on technology. Massive open online courses (<small>MOOC</small>s), like those from Imperial on EdX, provide resources for students aspiring to the highest <small>A</small>-level mathematics grades. They can see, and build towards, the standards of elite universities.</p><p class="article__body-text">A happy by-product, consumer surplus, even, is that many outside Britain are taking these free courses, including in low- and middle-income countries. For students, it raises ambitions. For talent-hungry universities, it’s enlightened self-interest.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PROFESSOR ALICE GAST</small><br/>President<br/>Imperial College London</p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/08/articles/body/20210724_asp502_0.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20210724_asp502_0.jpg" srcset="../image/20210724_asp502_0.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Demonyms</h2><p class="article__body-text">Surely the inhabitants of Kazakhstan are Kazakhs, rather than the clunky “Kazakhstanis” (“<a href="./kazakhstan-is-awash-in-fake-vaccination-passports.html">Get jabbed?
