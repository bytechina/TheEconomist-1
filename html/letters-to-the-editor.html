The figure you gave of 40bn cubic metres per annum (bcmpa) for the volume of gas transited from Russia via Ukraine is most certainly not a “theoretical capacity” of our extensive pipeline network. The Ukrainian system is designed to accommodate as much as 146 bcmpa of international transit. The image paints a picture in which Nord Stream 2 seems necessary; that is not so.</p><p class="article__body-text">In 2021 Gazprom, Russia’s state gas company, exported 175 bcmpa to Europe through five major gas corridors. It is obvious, when the Ukrainian transit system is properly reflected, that the existing east-west pipeline network is fully capable of handling the gas flow. If Germany were to double its imports of Russian gas in 2022, the existing east-west transit system could easily handle it and have spare capacity left. In fact, Germany can triple its imports of Russian gas and the need for Nord Stream 2 still will not arise.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It is also readily apparent that the current gas crunch is not a question of transit capacities. The International Energy Agency has correctly concluded that Russia is orchestrating Europe’s gas crisis. We have no doubts that if Nord Stream 2 becomes operational, gas flows via Ukraine will be terminated and Gazprom will control all incoming gas pipelines into Europe. It is still not too late for Germany and for Europe to reject Nord Stream 2 and decisively defend our shared energy security.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>SERGIY MAKOGON</small><br/>Chief executive<br/>Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine<br/><em>Kyiv</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220129_amd002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220129_amd002.jpg" srcset="../image/20220129_amd002.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Behind-the-scenes diplomacy</h2><p class="article__body-text">Bello stated that Soviet missiles were removed from Cuba in 1962 in return for an American promise not to invade the island (<a href="./russia-has-become-a-crucial-ally-of-venezuelas-dictatorship.html">January 29th</a>). Many academics consider America’s placement of missiles in Turkey as the trigger for the Soviet deployment in Cuba. Soon after the crisis America quietly removed its Turkish weapons. America didn’t have to advertise its concession and the Soviets got something they seriously wanted. With Ukraine in mind, diplomacy works on many levels.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>BRUCE BABCOCK</small><br/><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220115_srd001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220115_srd001.jpg" srcset="../image/20220115_srd001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>If I knew then…</h2><p class="article__body-text">Your special report on the state’s new interventionism revealed governments’ widespread enthusiasm for taxes and regulation (<a href="./governments-widespread-new-fondness-for-interventionism.html">January 15th</a>). You warned that politicians lack experience of the private sector and should not mess with the classic liberal principles rediscovered in the 1980s. That reminded me of a stunning admission by George McGovern, the Democrats’ presidential candidate in 1972, who steered the party well to the left. After earning a small fortune in post-retirement speeches, McGovern bought an inn in Connecticut. In 1990 it went bankrupt and closed the following year. In a column written for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in 1992, the Democratic lion blamed the failure on suffocating red tape. He described these myriad regulations as being worthy in their intention, but admitted:</p><blockquote><p>I…wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this first-hand experience about the difficulties businesspeople face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better us senator and a more understanding presidential contender.</p></blockquote><p class="article__body-text">Blanket rules on business ignore the reality of the marketplace.

(<a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/29/how-sanctions-really-can-improve-respect-for-human-rights">Banyan</a>, January 29th). Bangladesh has leapfrogged to Asia's highest growth economy in the IMF's World Economic Outlook, is consistently ranked on top in World Economic Forum's South Asian Gender Parity Index, and is the Global Terrorism Index's most successful country in South Asia in countering terrorism. Our law enforcement agencies have also helped maintain stability across our borders and the region, such as providing shelter for the Rohingyas.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The article overlooked the proud history of women's rights in our Muslim-majority country and the strides made by our girls and women breaking stereotypes and glass ceilings in every sphere. Bangladesh is a country where women have historically been on the frontlines of national movements and where more girls than boys attend educational institutions. The Economist appears to misunderstand the resilience of Bangladesh and that it has overcome the odds to stand tall as a thriving nation after just 50 years.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ASHEQUN NABI CHOWDHURY</small><br/>Minister (Press)<br/>Bangladesh High Commission<br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220115_usp002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220115_usp002.jpg" srcset="../image/20220115_usp002.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Mental-health responders</h2><p class="article__body-text">It is not “all but impossible” to determine which 911 calls can replace police with trained mental-health responders (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/01/15/as-violent-crime-leaps-liberal-cities-rethink-cutting-police-budgets">Refunding the police</a>”, January 15th). We have helped jurisdictions across America analyse hundreds of thousands of emergency calls, review call codes with law enforcement, identify situations that are less likely to result in arrest, rewrite call scripts to ask callers which emergency resources they need, and co-ordinate with clinicians who are embedded in 911 call centres to help triage mental-health calls. Initial data from communities that practise diversion tactics show that very few, if any, calls to alternative emergency- response programmes require law enforcement.</p><p class="article__body-text">In Denver’s programme, not a single call has required police backup. Los Angeles has diverted hundreds of suicide-related calls to a local hospital with specialised suicide-response units. These approaches are logical and practical and free up police to focus on public-safety incidents that are better aligned with their training.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>GLORIA GONG</small><br/>Executive director<br/>Government Performance Lab<br/>Harvard Kennedy School<br/><em>Cambridge, Massachusetts</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220122_ldd003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220122_ldd003.jpg" srcset="../image/20220122_ldd003.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Our new Culture section</h2><p class="article__body-text">Stories don’t only offer vicarious adventure and solidarity (“<a href="./introducing-our-new-culture-section.html">Food for thought</a>”, January 22nd), they have cognitive functions, too.
