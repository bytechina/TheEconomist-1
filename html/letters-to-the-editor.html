However, there is a big downside. Not everyone has equal access to these figures, especially to data collected by the private sector. This unequal access will widen the divide between the “haves” and the “have nots”. Democracies cannot work properly if citizens do not have an opportunity to access the economic information that is necessary to make good economic and voting decisions. Basing policy on summary statistics from inaccessible micro data with many possible flaws will only lead to more distrust.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>RALPH BRADLEY<br/></small>Former division chief<br/>Price and Index Number Research<br/>Bureau of Labour Statistics<br/><em>Washington,</em> <small>DC</small></p><p class="article__body-text">The connection you made between the value of real-time information and Salvador Allende’s Project Cybersyn is a reminder of a lost opportunity. One of Allende’s principal advisers when he was president of Chile was Stafford Beer, a visionary cyberneticist, then at Manchester Business School, who came up with the pioneering viable system model. Some of us were not entirely sure about Stafford’s connection with reality, but that was our mistake. Had Allende lived on we might now be much further ahead in this burgeoning field of analysis and administration.

Bridges in the Balkans have unfortunate connotations. The Peljesac bridge is lauded by its supporters for unifying Croatia but denigrated by its detractors for bypassing Bosnia. The Mitrovica bridge in northern Kosovo exists either as a tenuous link between Serbs and Albanians or as an insuperable barrier, depending on your perspective. The Mostar bridge was blown up in fighting between the Croats and the Bosniaks, who had been allies in the early stages of the Yugoslav civil war.</p><p class="article__body-text">Before the European Union can even consider enlargement, it needs to deal with these and other festering sores, such as the disputed waters between Slovenia, Italy and Croatia. These may seem minor issues, but they matter hugely to those who live there.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>RICHARD SCOTT<br/></small><em>Exeter</em></p><h2>Shakespearean phraseology</h2><p class="article__body-text">Echoing Hamlet, you said that vaccine mandates in poor countries are often “honoured in the breach”, suggesting that the edicts are not complied with (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/23/the-impact-of-vaccine-mandates-is-modest-but-potentially-crucial">Strictly come jabbing</a>”, October 23rd). Shakespeare’s phrase has a more nuanced meaning. In the passage where Hamlet says that the Danish custom of boozy revelry is “More honour’d in the breach than the observance”, he means that it is more honourable to ignore the custom of drunken carousing than to follow it. So Shakespeare is referring to a practice that is best ignored than followed, not merely one that is often ignored.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>JOHN DOHERTY<br/></small><em>Stratford-upon-Avon</em></p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Singapore<em><br/></em></strong><span>You claim that Singapore’s Foreign Interference Countermeasures Act (FICA) would allow the government to compel internet companies to take action against hostile information campaigns “without giving a reason” (“Outside job, October 23rd). </span><br/><br/><span>Under sections 20 and 21 of FICA, the government may only issue directions if such a campaign is undertaken by or on behalf of a foreign principal, and where the direction is necessary or expedient in the public interest.

The German government has proposed carbon contracts for difference (<small>CCFD</small>s) to mitigate the problem. Under these contracts the government and a company set a price at which its zero carbon hydrogen technology would be competitive. Until the agreed carbon price is reached, the government pays the price difference to the company. Once the price is exceeded, the payment direction is reversed.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>CCFD</small>s have three benefits. Carbon prices become predictable for the length of the contract. Subsidised technology can compete with carbon-emitting incumbents. And should carbon prices rise above the set price during the contract period, the government subsidies could be recovered and the necessity for the contract vanishes.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>TIMOTHéE HORNEK<br/></small><em>Tuttlingen, Germany<br/></em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/11/articles/body/20211016_map003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211016_map003.jpg" srcset="../image/20211016_map003.jpg"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dubai’s Expo</strong><br/><em>The Economist</em> praised the non-political nature of the Great Exhibition in 1851 (“The Exhibition.

Surprisingly, today’s <em>Economist </em>assesses Dubai’s Expo as glossing over politics, based on a patronising interpretation of the first Expo to be hosted in our region (“<a href="./at-the-dubai-expo-no-one-is-eager-to-talk-about-reality.html">The far-fetched pavilions”, October 16th</a>).
