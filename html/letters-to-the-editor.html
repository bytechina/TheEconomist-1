After all, a succession of leaders from Marlborough through Pitt to Lloyd George and Churchill strove successfully and at considerable cost to ensure that Britain exercised a part in shaping the politics and economy of the continent to which we belong. Now that objective seems to have been abandoned without a thought as to the unintended consequences.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Moreover, the glorification of national sovereignty was tried in Europe after the first world war and it did not end terribly well. Nearly all of the American presidents since 1945, and certainly the present incumbent, have taken a contrary view on Britain’s role in Europe and the dangers of unfettered national sovereignty in that continent.</p><p class="article__body-text">So, quite a fundamental rupture. Whether or not those you described, somewhat dismissively, as “the old guard of the diplomatic service” in fact hate Lord Frost’s guts is, frankly, irrelevant. What matters is whether he is on the right side of history.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>DAVID HANNAY</small><br/>House of Lords<br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211127_irp001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211127_irp001.jpg" srcset="../image/20211127_irp001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Nary starry night</h2><p class="article__body-text">We read your article on how bright satellite constellations are blocking the view of the cosmos for astronomers (“<a href="./vast-satellite-constellations-are-alarming-astronomers.html">Goodbye darkness, my old friend</a>”, November 27th). In America the Federal Communications Commission has already approved licences for thousands of satellites and associated Earth stations. In doing so, it has failed to meet its legal responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires agencies to analyse environmental effects with public input before taking such actions. In virtually all instances, the <small>FCC</small> authorises satellites without any substantive environmental review.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Real and potential environmental harm from proposed satellite mega-constellations go beyond interfering with astronomy. Light pollution can affect migrating birds, sea turtles and pollinating insects. It also degrades celestial views sacred to many throughout history. The satellites will add significant amounts of debris and chemicals to the atmosphere, including one that depletes ozone. But the <small>FCC</small> continues to authorise these satellites, fundamentally changing the night sky for everyone.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>RUSKIN HARTLEY</small><br/>Executive director<br/>International Dark-Sky Association<br/><em>Tucson, Arizona</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ERICA ROSENBERG</small><br/>Former attorney at the Federal Communications Commission<br/><em>Washington, DC</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211204_ldp502.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211204_ldp502.jpg" srcset="../image/20211204_ldp502.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>A pinch of salt</h2><p class="article__body-text">A point missed in your leader about the deduction on state and local taxes (<small>SALT</small>) in America is that states with high state taxes generally contribute more in federal taxes than they receive in federal funds (“<a href="./the-democrats-fiscal-policy-makes-a-mockery-of-their-progressive-pledges.html"><small>SALT</small> in the wounds</a>”, December 4th). States with low state taxes generally receive more from the federal government than they contribute and are more dependent on the federal purse.</p><p class="article__body-text">I live in California and pay significant state taxes as well as the regular federal taxes. California chooses to finance its own social programmes whereas other states choose to rely on federal handouts. California residents thus subsidise the low-tax states. Without <small>SALT</small> we get to pay twice: once for ourselves and once for the deadbeat states.</p><p class="article__body-text">Kentucky is a fine example. Low state taxes, federal subsidies and poverty. The senators from Kentucky despise socialism but their state substantially relies on federal support from other states.

American cheese had plenty of varieties and quality before Anne Saxelby, whom you said had “no domestic-cheese culture to build on”. Poppycock! Most of the early cheese practitioners were of European origin and their descendants carry on those rich traditions with their own innovations.</p><p class="article__body-text">I took particular umbrage at your comments about our cheddar, “pale attempt” indeed. I urge you to try some top quality Aged New York-style cheddar from Cabot Creamery, some Wisconsin-style cheddar, or great Tillamook Creamery West Coast cheddar. All three are distinctly different and dare I say better than the original.</p><p class="article__body-text">If you really want to get the flavour of American cheese you should attend the World Cheese Expo in Milwaukee next April.

One trailblazer in the world of mobile-phone repairs is Fairphone. The same iFixit website you referred to gives Fairphone top marks for repairability.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are arguably downsides to the ease of repair, however the series of Fairphones have come along in leaps and bounds in terms of performance and reliability over the past decade. It seems only fair to give Fairphone due credit for having led the way over these past years, waiting for the rest of the industry to wake up and take notice.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ULRIC SCHWELA</small><br/>Director<br/>Salus Mineralis<br/><em>Thornton, Lancashire</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211127_bkp001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211127_bkp001.jpg" srcset="../image/20211127_bkp001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Heading for the exit</h2><p class="article__body-text">“<a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/27/in-preparing-for-disasters-museums-face-tough-choices">Safeguarding art</a>” (November 27th) looked at how museums decide which pieces of work to save in the event of a fire.
