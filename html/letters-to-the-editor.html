You should have a better understanding about why some people are frustrated with covid-19 measures.</p><p class="article__body-text">The vaccines have saved many lives. I think that getting the vaccine is the best decision for your health as well as other people’s. That said, I want to make the decision on whether I get vaccinated (which I have) after speaking to my doctor and doing my own research. It upsets me greatly that government officials want to make this decision in my stead through compulsion. And it is unclear where the line will be drawn once government has decided in effect to force adults into taking medication. I am in Germany being coerced into getting a booster shot. I am a young person. Government mandates cannot be fine tuned to fit all of us.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Many scientists and lay people have legitimate concerns over governments’ obsession with covid over anything else. Most people protesting in Austria and Germany are not anti-vax, but anti-coercion. They do not want government to micromanage their lives, for example deciding that meeting nine people outside is safe but 11 isn’t. I do not want to be dismissed as simply “anti-vax”.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>JOSE GARRIDO RAMAS</small><br/>Machine-learning scientist<br/><em>Berlin</em></p><p class="article__body-text">The word vaccine does indeed derive from the Latin for cow (<a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2022/01/01/what-is-the-economists-word-of-the-year-for-2021">Johnson</a>, January 1st). But it was not named after a treatment for cowpox. Live cowpox was the vaccine itself. Edward Jenner infected a boy first with cowpox and then with the much more deadly smallpox (<em>variola</em>). Luckily for Jenner, us, and the boy, he survived.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>BENJAMIN JOHNSON</small><br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/02/articles/body/20220122_brp501.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20220122_brp501.jpg" srcset="../image/20220122_brp501.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Britain’s public broadcaster</h2><p class="article__body-text">Winston Churchill’s suspicion that the <small>BBC</small> was “run by reds” (“<a href="./tory-mps-love-to-hate-the-bbc-but-tory-voters-love-to-watch-it.html">Telly addicts</a>”, January 22nd) went back to what he thought was its unduly impartial coverage of the General Strike of 1926.

Restaurant workers’ pay is boosted by customers’ tips, lowering the owners’ costs. This wage subsidy, a free lunch for the proprietors, has no justification in a sophisticated labour market.</p><p class="article__body-text">The remuneration of waiting staff is a cost of doing business. So the service should be included in the bill as part of the cost of the meal, which is the norm in most of Europe. Restaurant employees should become fully fledged members of the normal labour force, with minimum wages and benefits, including health care, unemployment insurance and so on. Waiting staff will adapt, as they will to the coming robotisation of restaurants, when diners will be able to choose low-cost meals with no service. Tasks that can be automated include digital menus, online payment and robots to perform chores such as removing dishes.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Call this structural change, without which living standards would stagnate.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>IRA SOHN</small><br/>Emeritus professor of economics and finance<br/>Montclair State University<br/><em>Upper Montclair, New Jersey</em></p><p class="article__body-text">Many American states have lower minimum wages for restaurant servers, using the practice of tipping as a justification. That has led customers to tip more generously, which in turn is used by policy makers to justify the lower minimum wage, creating a never-ending low-wage cycle.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ROBERT CHECCHIO</small><br/><em>Dunellen, New Jersey</em></p><p class="article__body-text">In 2019 it was estimated that $300bn dollars was spent in full-service restaurants in the United States, which equated to $60bn for tipped employees. More than 13m people were employed in American restaurants, approximately 10% of all American workers. Many of these employees count on tips from customers for their lifestyles. I personally believe that everywhere in America these tips should be legally and morally divided among the entire staff for each service.</p><p class="article__body-text">This was a well-researched, well-written and well-argued article, but it is obvious that the differences in tipping customs from Tokyo to Paris to New York cannot be compared in any way from the customer’s or the tipped employee’s point of view. It’s different strokes for different folks.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ALAN STILLMAN</small><br/>Founder of Smith &amp; Wollensky restaurants<br/><em>New York</em></p><p class="article__body-text">Brazil, Italy, Japan, South Korea and many other countries provide much better service than places where the tipping system applies. Actually, the higher the expected add-on, the worse the service is. America and the Netherlands top my tip list for abysmal service and food. “But you must tip!” is the common cry by the establishment. Really? Ditch tipping. You will have a less fictional, hypocritical server and a more relaxed customer.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>DAVIDE CARDARELLI</small><br/><em>Johannesburg</em></p><p class="article__body-text">What an elaborate discussion on tipping. The most common reason for leaving a tip in my experience has been to compensate food servers who have universally been paid a cut-rate wage. During this pandemic the tips I give for even take-out food have been larger, since the job market has become more precarious. God forbid that I should tip a dental hygienist, car mechanic, or a vet, all of whom earn far more than food-service workers.
