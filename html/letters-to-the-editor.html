Looking to politicians for a clear answer as to what constitutes reasonable self-defence is impractical. These are the same politicians who, depending on whether they appeared on <small>MSNBC</small> or Fox News, described the trouble in Kenosha as either a peaceful demonstration or riotous looting. To these politicians Mr Rittenhouse is either a vigilante chaos-tourist who wanted to kill innocent people, or a well-meaning young man who looked to protect his community and was ambushed by mentally deranged criminals.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">These are the same politicians, including our president, who publicly communicate their opinion about a defendant before the jury’s conclusions.

We take issue, however, with the assumption that Centerra, the mine’s owner, did not engage with the Kyrgyz government about how it could best benefit the country and its people. For nearly 30 years Centerra and its predecessor have operated the Kumtor concession in close co-operation with many Kyrgyz governments. As the largest private employer in Kyrgyzstan (more than 99% of employees are Kyrgyz nationals), Kumtor contributed almost $4.5bn to the economy between 1994 and 2020.</p><p class="article__body-text">We have always resolved disputes with successive Kyrgyz administrations through negotiation and compromise, yet the current government has shown no willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue since sending secret police to seize the mine on May 15th. The government’s illegal conduct threatens not just Centerra’s interests but the future of foreign direct investment in Kyrgyzstan.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>SCOTT PERRY</small><br/>Chief executive officer<br/>Centerra Gold Inc.<br/><em>Toronto</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211120_ldp003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211120_ldp003.jpg" srcset="../image/20211120_ldp003.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Investment and rents</h2><p class="article__body-text">Governments are wrong, you say, to think that allowing private-equity firms into housing markets will drive up rents (“<a href="./hostility-towards-private-equitys-push-into-property-is-misguided.html">Barbarians at the garden gates</a>”, November 20th). Your reasoning implies that more invest ment in housing should be welcomed because it would bring down house and rental prices. This is not the case. In many countries, private equity has invested primarily, and sometimes exclusively, in existing housing stock. This was certainly the experience in the two largest European markets for private-equity investment, Germany and Spain. Landlords increased rents and often failed to maintain properties.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Even when investment takes place in new construction rather than existing housing, we cannot assume that more supply automatically lowers prices. This has definitely not been the case in Spain and Ireland. Both countries heavily oversupplied housing in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Did prices fall? No. They rose well above the European average.</p><p class="article__body-text">House prices are no longer simply driven by housing supply and demand, but rather by the supply of finance to housing. Expanding mortgage credit drives up prices, as does the arrival of new landlords who think they can make more money than current landlords. And investments require returns. If investors pay a higher price so, inevitably, will their tenants.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PROFESSOR MANUEL AALBERS</small><br/>University of Leuven<br/><em>Leuven, Belgium</em></p><p class="article__body-text">Allowing private equity in housing should not come at the expense of the push for equitable housing, especially mandatory requirements for affordable housing. These require that a certain percentage of newly built homes have cheap rents for people on low incomes. The homes in a development that are sold at market rate subsidise the affordable ones, making the venture profitable. Affordable-housing policies allow big funds to make a return while providing inexpensive homes to a city’s working class.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ANTHONY HASCHEFF</small><br/><em>New York</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211106_fbd001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211106_fbd001.jpg" srcset="../image/20211106_fbd001.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Struggling to get ahead</h2><p class="article__body-text">The case for investing in social mobility in America is stronger than your briefing suggests, because it rests on political as well as economic grounds (“<a href="./the-democrats-social-spending-package-cannot-repair-the-american-dream.html">Stuck in place</a>”, November 6th). In a recent paper Philip McCann, who coined the term “geography of discontent”, wrote that “Social mobility is the crucial indicator of populist voting.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Contrary to popular perceptions, populist voters are not uniformly deplorable, stupid and racist; they are deeply motivated by perceptions of a rigged, socially immobile economy. Whether a citizen has an unlucky start in life or is knocked down by an economic crisis, too many Americans cannot get ahead on their own merits. Given the Democrats’ recent drubbing in Virginia, the party would do well to pivot away from condescending culture wars and towards a fairer economy where opportunity is more equal and reward is allocated in line with contribution.</p><p class="article__body-text">It is important that the message of social mobility is not confused with income and wealth inequality. We have shown that the latter are poor predictors of populism. People generally prefer fair economic outcomes regardless of whether they are equal or unequal.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ERIC PROTZER</small><br/>Research fellow<br/>Growth Lab<br/>John F.

Indeed. In 1282 a royal charter was granted establishing the Bridge House Estates as a charity to maintain London Bridge and subsequently other bridges leading into the City of London. Today it stewards a fund of around £1.6bn ($2.1bn). A simple solution to London’s bridge woes would be to place them in the charity’s ownership, and for the local council authorities to pay an annual fee in exchange for ongoing maintenance.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>CALUM GALLEITCH</small><br/><em>Gordon, Scottish Borders</em></p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211120_wbd002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211120_wbd002.jpg" srcset="../image/20211120_wbd002.jpg"/></div></figure><h2>Business phraseology</h2><p class="article__body-text">Thank you to <a href="./the-business-phrasebook.html">Bartleby </a>for his short guides to business speak (November 20th).
