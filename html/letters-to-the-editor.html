Companies and investors alike have spent the best part of 20 years worshipping at the altar of carbon markets only to find that politics gets in the way of a sufficient price. As a result, investors have had to evaluate emissions (and other <small>esg</small> factors such as board competency, transition plans and stakeholder impacts) and trade on the risk of future prices and regulation to prepare for the economic transition ahead. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>esg</small> provides a framework to assess the interconnectedness of these issues in a way that better reflects policy and economic realities. For example, the economic transition required to reduce emissions is also an inherently social transition. Take the <i>gilets jaunes</i> protests in France, where an increase in fuel duty, nominally with the aim of curbing carbon emissions, led to months of disruptive civil unrest. No government, investor or business can consider pathways for policy reforms without considering their wider ramifications and the volatility that may result for markets.

That is because many of its aspects are seen through a de-risking lens, or as a niche overlay to mainstream investment products, rather than to align economic activity with what our planet can sustainably provide. </p><p class="article__body-text">Therefore, I am deeply concerned by the suggestion to reduce <small>esg</small> to emissions alone, which ignores wider environmental impacts such as water security, biodiversity and deforestation. Focusing on emissions alone will not help us to build resilience to the climate shocks coming our way. Without biodiversity humans cannot eat or make medicines. Indeed, we cannot solve the climate crisis, as at least a third of all scientifically required emission reductions are linked to forestation and the water cycle. More than half of the world’s <small>gdp</small> relies on nature and its services. Losing it is an existential threat.

The entire continent of Africa contributes 3.8% to global emissions, for example, and the poorest 50% of the global population are estimated to contribute around just 7% of emissions. The <small>s</small> imperative goes beyond climate adaptation. Social inequities and inequality lead to unrest, conflicts and political instability.

It should ensure that organisations perform ethically, are effective and can efficiently achieve their planned outcomes. </p><p class="article__body-text">However, we agree with <i>The Economist</i> that, in general, the way <small>esg</small> is applied is highly problematic.

I estimate that more than $2trn of global capital is invested according to impact principles. These principles rest on transparency.

Big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning are enabling us to measure and value physical impacts and integrate them into financial analysis and the valuation of companies.</p><p class="article__body-text">This evolution is exemplified by the efforts of the Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative at Harvard Business School.

A fiduciary investor owning the likes of ExxonMobil, for example, could hardly be an effective advocate for the rapid curtailment of its oil and gas production, or for badly needed public policies that would price carbon emissions, or boost substitutes, any of which could tank Exxon’s stock. The line between engagement and complicity is a fuzzy one, if it is there at all. Or is investor engagement just another “greenwashing” to justify the opportunity to capture some juicy returns?</p><p class="article__body-text">Also, the key goal of divestment strategies is not to drive up the cost of capital of high emitters. Instead, the idea is to decrease the number of stakeholders in such enterprises to weaken their political power, so that proper pricing and regulation can be put in place. One need only look to the decline of the tobacco lobby, and the end of tobacco advertising, to see how things might proceed if fewer had a vested interest in continued profits from high-emitting enterprises.</p><p class="article__body-text">Deep-pocketed investors interested in saving the planet might best be served by donating to politicians and organisations that might actually act to raise carbon prices, or accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>james jampel</small><br/>Founder and co-chief investment officer<br/><small>hite</small> Hedge Asset Management<br/><i>Boston</i></p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220709_USP002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="February 3, 2021, Michigan, USA: Dave Buchanan, center left, throws a grass carp to the middle of the boat as Clint Carter continues to pull up fishing net on the Illinois River in Chillicothe, Ill.,  Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021.

It’s really a question of ambition and approach. I know of one developer proposing the installation of sufficient floating offshore wind capacity to generate at least 1.5GW of green hydrogen capacity.<br/><br/>To attract the investment into the necessary infrastructure, we must find a way to accelerate the award of leases for large floating offshore wind farms and grant contracts for differences to ensure ambition can marry with the opportunity to achieve our climate goals.
