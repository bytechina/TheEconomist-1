He is considering relinquishing power back to the states on a policy issue, rather than taking power. The constitution contains no clear law on abortion. In <i>Roe v Wade</i>, Justice Harry Blackmun had to torture the words of the constitutional text in order to find a federal right to an abortion. It was an egregious act of judicial activism. Justice Alito is simply showing that the issue is complex and returning the question to the people to decide through state legislatures. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Nor is it the case that the court only rules on policy where Congress has failed to. In the case of gay marriage, Congress had taken clear action by passing the Defence of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. The court overturned that democratic decision. Again, there was no provision on a policy (gay marriage) in the constitution. </p><p class="article__body-text"><small>lantz mcclain</small><br/><i>Sapulpa, Oklahoma</i></p><p class="article__body-text">Many religious people believe that sexual relations are solely for the purpose of bearing children.

In fact, Canada does not have any laws on abortion. The procedure is legal at any age for any reason, including sex selection or eliminating those with potential disabilities. Some hospitals and doctors have their own limits and will refuse to carry out very late-term abortions, but there is no legal reason why they could not. </p><p class="article__body-text">We are working to introduce an International Standards Abortion Law, which would ensure that all women who seek an abortion have access to independent counselling, are given a 48-hour waiting period between requesting an abortion and the actual procedure and which would restrict abortion after the first trimester. Around 70% of Canadians are opposed to abortion in the third trimester. Surely the time has come for Canada to extend at least some protection to the unborn. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>anna nienhuis</small><br/>Policy analyst<br/>WeNeedaLaw<br/><i>Ottawa, Canada</i></p><p class="article__body-text">You briefly mentioned the citizens’ assembly in Ireland.

It’s true: Russian soldiers invading Ukraine could do worse than read it. They could also learn from Hasek’s version of the theory that commerce civilises people. When asked whether he likes the “heathen” Turks, Palivec, the coarse barkeeper at a local pub, says that he welcomes all guests to his establishment, no matter the nationality: “For us tradesmen there’s no politics.

A third of <small>gp</small>s are thinking of retiring or leaving the profession in the next five years. Boris Johnson’s plan for a net gain of 6,000 more <small>gp</small>s by 2025 is, so far, nothing but hot air.

The assumption seems to be that degenerate Latin alone eventually created the members of that language family. Yet many of the local populations that were conquered by Rome spoke unwritten Celtic languages, which surely interbred with Latin to create Romance languages. </p><p class="article__body-text">One of my favourite examples of the evolution of a Celtic word is <i>colleen</i>, a generic word for girls, into Colleen as a girl’s proper name. I like to imagine a Viking father who settled down in Britain with a Celtic wife hearing her call for <i>colleen</i> and misunderstanding it as the girl’s name. And <i>avon</i> means river in Celtic.
