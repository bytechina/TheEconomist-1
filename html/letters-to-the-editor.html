This is not a collision of models. That would depict two competing ideals. Ukraine was never offering an alternative model to Russia, in the way that America offered an alternative to the Soviet Union during the cold war. Rather, the conflict is about Russia subjugating the Ukrainian populace to a warped interpretation of history emanating from the Russian government. </p><p class="article__body-text">The Russian International Affairs Council is funded by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Mr Kortunov, as the <small>riac</small>’s director-general, has in the past repeated the mantra that Europe’s security architecture needs to be changed to accommodate Russia.

Why should Europe evolve its security to placate a bully that has always found new excuses to justify its unhappiness? </p><p class="article__body-text">This war is more about the aggrandisement of Russia and the sense that we should conciliate the Kremlin regardless of its actions; these should not be represented as anything but Russian aggression.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>stephen g.f. hall</small><br/>Lecturer (assistant professor) in politics<br/>University of Bath</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220528_LDP001.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="UVALDE, TEXAS - MAY 24: People mourn outside of the SSGT Willie de Leon Civic Center following the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022 in Uvalde, Texas.

When I was deployed to Saigon at the height of the Vietnam war the army prohibited us from routinely carrying firearms in the city. This regulation almost certainly saved lives; off-duty troops had easy access to alcohol, but without weapons they were less likely to cause innocent deaths or to frequent dangerous areas.

While the 30% increase in strength and other beneficial properties for concrete applications are certainly attracting attention, what has truly excited industry is the direct reduction in carbon-dioxide output during the cement manufacturing process. The biggest offender, but a necessary ingredient, in cement manufacturing, is something called “clinker”. It is the binding agent created in the way you outlined by roasting limestone and various compounds at high temperatures to burn off carbon. </p><p class="article__body-text">Advanced testing by First Graphene in conjunction with some of the world’s biggest cement-additive manufacturers shows that replacing the bulk of the clinker with very small amounts of graphene can reduce carbon emissions by up to 20% while, at the very least, maintaining the same performance characteristics as current cement products. </p><p class="article__body-text"><small>michael bell</small><br/>Chief executive<br/>First Graphene<br/><i>Henderson, Australia</i></p><h2>Remembering Tokyo</h2><p class="article__body-text">Regarding your fine obituary for Saotome Katsumoto (<a href="./saotome-katsumoto-insisted-that-japan-should-not-forget.html">May 21st</a>), the firebombing of Tokyo in March 1945 has become a mere historical footnote. In fact, 70 of Japan’s largest cities were virtually destroyed by incendiary bombs in the first half of 1945, before the atomic bombings. Combined with the naval blockade, this practically reduced Japanese civilians to starvation. </p><p class="article__body-text">Nowhere is this subject more sensitively and devastatingly portrayed than in “Grave of the Fireflies,” an anime film written and directed by Takahata Isao in 1988. It follows the path of two orphaned siblings struggling to survive the final grim months of the war.

American job titles and terminology are an unstoppable force. The <small>bbc</small> seems to train its journalists in New York or Chicago. They regularly speak of candidates running rather than standing for office, or of putting their names to a ticket. We hear of stump speeches, no doubt given on whistle-stop tours, although I don’t think I’ve ever known a British politician speak from a train “on the campaign trail”. </p><p class="article__body-text">How long until we have primaries or are asked to vote for a district attorney, town sheriff or judge?

America’s bear season runs from whenever they come out of their dens to whenever they return to them. Even in the coldest localities, bears are active for five or six months of the year, not for “two months from September”. As for hikers being advised to stay on their trails in bear season, bears like trails too and we are just as likely to encounter them there as when we are bushwhacking. </p><p class="article__body-text">The good news is that bears do not pursue humans as aggressively as writers pursue arresting opening lines.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>robert mcwilliams</small><br/><i>New Haven, Connecticut</i></p></div></body></html>
