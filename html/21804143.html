A gene called Membrane Associated Ring-<small>CH</small>-type finger 1, commonly known as <small>MARCH1</small>, is, for instance, frequently re-encoded as the date March 1. Something similar happens to genes in the Septin family, of which <small>SEPT1</small> is a member, and to Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Family Member <small>E41</small>, often known as <small>DEC2</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">This problem was first noticed in 2004, but was brought to wider attention in 2016 by Mark Ziemann of Deakin University, in Australia. In July Dr Ziemann followed up with a paper in <small>PLOS</small><em> Computational Biology</em> entitled “Gene name errors: Lessons not learned”. By surveying 166,000 genomics-related papers published between 2014 and 2020, he and his co-authors showed that the number of papers using Excel has steadily increased, and the proportion plagued with autocorrect errors continues to hover at around 30%.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Errors have also been flagged by researchers in other languages. In Portuguese, for instance, <small>AGO2</small> (Argonaute <small>RISC</small> Catalytic Component 2) rebrands itself as Agosto 2. Dutch users experience problems with <small>MEI1</small> (Meiotic Double-Stranded Break Formation Protein 1), “Mei” being the Dutch for “May”. And geneticists in Finland, where the first month of the year is called Tammikuu, find <small>TAMM41</small> (Mitochondrial Translocator Assembly And Maintenance Protein) encoding itself as the 41st of January.</p><p class="article__body-text">This continuing state of affairs is surprising. In August 2020, aware they were playing David to Microsoft’s Goliath, the committee which standardises gene names renamed those beginning <small>MARC</small>, <small>MARCH</small> and <small>SEPT</small> to begin <small>MTARC</small>, <small>MARCHF</small> and <small>SEPTIN</small>, and rebranded <small>DEC1</small> as <small>DELEC1</small>. Other problematic gene names remained, but this was widely seen as a step in the right direction. Dr Ziemann’s latest paper, though, suggests that few researchers have taken it.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such errors often seem amusing rather than dangerous. But they reflect a deeper problem, which is that spreadsheets allow such silent errors, too well camouflaged for authors or their editors to spot, to go undetected for years. To stop this, Dr Ziemann recommends researchers abandon software like Excel in favour of bespoke code written with scientific applications in mind. Such programs are less susceptible to erroneous autocorrections and easier to audit. Whether his advice will be heeded this time round remains to be seen.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on September 1st 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "Autoincorrect"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Software%20is%20subbing%20mistakes%20into%20scientific%20papers&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-02&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fbt950tihu76nlukpat9r4mqremudvrv7&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
