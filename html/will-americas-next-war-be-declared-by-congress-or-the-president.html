The constitution vests Congress with the awesome power to declare war, so it is a persistent source of vexation on Capitol Hill that presidents so often drop bombs without asking permission. Yet it is possible to understand why presidents might roll their eyes at that prospect considering how much difficulty Congress is having resolving a far less weighty question: when is it the right time to undeclare a war?</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/will-americas-next-war-be-declared-by-congress-or-the-president.mp3" title="Will America’s next war be declared by Congress or the president?"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">At issue are two congressional authorisations to wage war in Iraq, the first issued 30 years ago, the second 19 years ago, both to presidents called George Bush. The first war ended years before the second began, and the second ended almost ten years ago. Yet both laws remain on the books, and presidents remain free to start a war against Iraq. They have not chosen to, presumably because Iraq is now an ally.</p><p class="article__body-text">Earlier this summer, after years of struggle by a handful of senators, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took a step towards revoking the Iraq authorisations by voting to let the full Senate consider a bill to do so. Its supporters, and even its opponents, see it as a small step towards Congress reasserting its power over warmaking. Some in Congress hope to turn next to revising another legacy of 9/11, the authorisation of force in 2001 that four successive presidents have relied on to wage America’s “war on terror” in 14 countries. Yet even the revocation of the two Iraq war resolutions is not assured.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In explaining his vote against that bill, the leading Republican on the committee, James Risch of Idaho, noted that “virtually all of us have the same agreement” about the need for Congress to assert itself, and he conceded the bill would have “zero effect” on a president’s ability to respond to threats. But by repealing these authorisations, Congress would send a dangerous signal to Iran, he warned. “There are people that are going to look at this and say, ‘Aha, the <small>US</small> is getting weak on the region’.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went a step further—in both directions. He said he opposed the last Iraq war and that it was “a good thing” to repeal the authorisations. “We have allowed executives, both Republican and Democrat, far too much leeway in exercising the awesome might of calling into battle the <small>US</small> armed forces,” he said. Yet he added that he would vote against the bill unless it was amended to give the president even more leeway to use force in the future, because he was also worried about Iran. This is the pickle several hawkish lawmakers find themselves in. They want to undeclare these wars, because they worry that the president, particularly one from another party, feels too free to wage war. But they do not want to undeclare these wars—because they fear the president might not go to war.</p><p class="article__body-text">The constitution says Congress, not the president, “shall have Power” to declare war. In theory, the president appeals to Congress for authority to fight or even for a declaration of war, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt did after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. But voting for a war can be politically risky, as can voting to end a war, which might be seen as undermining troops in the field.</p><p class="article__body-text">For their part, presidents do not like to be constrained by Congress, and they have taken to stretching previous congressional authorisations rather than seeking new ones. The classic example is the authorisation in 2001 to use force against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, which Congress passed less than a week after the World Trade Centre fell. That is the authorisation that Barack Obama invoked to strike at Islamic State (<small>IS</small>), which did not even exist in 2001.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden relied on the same authority in August to justify air strikes in Somalia against what the military chiefs said were al-Qaeda affiliates. Lawmakers of both parties criticised that rationale as exceeding Congress’s intent. But despite such objections, Congress has given its implicit approval to these acts of presidential creativity by appropriating money as the military mission expanded. The bill pending before the Senate does not touch the authorisation of 2001, and rewriting it will be a much tougher political proposition.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet as the last Iraq war shows, Congress does not necessarily get it right when it does provide authority to use force. Claims by the administration that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction proved false, and many members of Congress came to regret their votes. In any case, presidents often insist no authorisation is needed. When Mr Obama intervened in Libya as part of a <small>NATO</small> coalition in 2011, the Justice Department contended the president was acting within his constitutional authority because the use of force was in the national interest and limited in “anticipated nature, scope and duration”. The bombing campaign lasted for months and helped topple the Libyan regime.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/851/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210904_USP004_0.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20210904_USP004_0.jpg" srcset="../image/20210904_USP004_0.jpg"/></div><figcaption>Where it all started</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text">Congress spent more time investigating the killing of four American officials and contractors in Benghazi, Libya than it did looking into the 9/11 attacks. But though some representatives grumbled about Mr Obama’s assertion of presidential power, Congress held only a handful of hearings on the intervention in Libya itself. Such scrutiny might have saved Mr Obama from what he later called the worst mistake of his presidency, the failure to plan for the aftermath of the intervention.</p><p class="article__body-text">Barely a month after Mr Biden became president he dispatched two <small>F</small>-15 fighters to fire missiles at facilities in Syria which the armed forces said were controlled by Iranian militias. The administration said the strike was legal because it was an act of self-defence, in response to attacks on American personnel in Iraq, and also an effort to deter future attacks. Though Republicans were generally supportive, some influential Democrats did not buy the argument. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a leader of congressional efforts to constrain presidential warmaking, declared that “offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The administration did not retreat from its legal claim. But Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Mr Biden wants to work with Congress to replace “outdated authorisations” for using force with “narrow and specific frameworks”. That might help restore some balance between Congress and the president when it comes to starting wars. But after America stumbled out of Afghanistan, 20 years after invading it, one hard lesson is that, regardless of which branch of government starts a war, America would benefit most from dogged congressional oversight of how that war is conducted. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Wauthorisation"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Will%20America%E2%80%99s%20next%20war%20be%20declared%20by%20Congress%20or%20the%20president%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-02&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F8urmajv9ohm5gdv5pech6sugrp2mkhoo&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
