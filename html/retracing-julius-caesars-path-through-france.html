His “Commentaries on the Gallic Wars” is a fine work of literature. Cicero likened his prose to “nude figures, upright and beautiful, stripped of all ornament of style”. The “Gallic Wars” is also the only first-hand account of an ancient campaign written by a general of such stature. It is a priceless source for historians, yet also a slippery piece of propaganda. A quip apocryphally attributed to Winston Churchill could as easily have been Caesar’s: “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it.”</p><p class="article__body-text">A copy of the “Gallic Wars” in hand (on a non-stone tablet), <em>The Economist</em> retraced some of Caesar’s steps, using fast French trains rather than oxcarts on Gaulish roads that had not yet had the benefit of Roman engineering. The aim was not merely to retell Caesar’s bloody, dramatic tale, but to look at how modern historians have questioned it. And also to ask what we can learn from the most consequential writer-soldier-statesman in European history. We, too, live in a world where men with armies misbehave, where politicians twist the truth, and where it is not clear which culture will be dominant in the decades to come. Studying Caesar may help us understand our own age better.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">An observant reader swiftly spots that Caesar peddled fake news worthy of any modern demagogue. In one battle he claims to have routed an army of 430,000 Germans without losing a single legionary. Since he had no atom bombs, this seems doubtful.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar was not trying to write objective history. His aim was to increase his power. In 58<small>BC</small>, when the action began, he was not yet the master of Rome. He was one of a triumvirate of strongmen, along with Pompey (a general) and Crassus (a plutocrat). Having lavished sums on the Romans to buy popularity, Caesar was deeply in debt. He also faced possible prosecution for offences committed as consul the previous year, such as using troops to intimidate his political opponents.</p><p class="article__body-text">A military campaign was a chance to pay off those debts, from plunder. And his dispatches from Gaul burnished his reputation as a brilliant military leader. Like Charles Dickens, he probably published his work in instalments. Each year he sent another chapter to the Senate and had it circulated in Rome.</p><p class="article__body-text">Unlike some other Roman authors, he was interested in non-Romans. He offers insights into cultures that left no written accounts of their own. “Gallic funerals are splendid and costly, for a comparatively poor country,” he observes. “Husbands have power of life and death over their wives and children.”</p><p class="article__body-text">He notes that the Germans shunned agriculture, preferring to live on milk, cheese and meat; that German men strove to remain celibate as long as possible, believing it would make them stronger, and that German tribes “regard it as their greatest glory to lay waste as much as possible of the land around them and to keep it uninhabited” to remove “any fear of sudden invasion”. Yet they were hospitable towards guests.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Caesar makes outrageous generalisations. “Anger and impetuosity”, he writes, are “the most striking characteristic of the Gallic race.” The Gauls are quick to take up arms, but “have not the strength of character to stand up against reverses”. Some of his claims drew on earlier writers or hearsay. Did the Druids really burn wicker men full of human sacrificial victims? There is no archaeological evidence for this calumny. It is widely believed today only because Caesar wrote it. As for his belief that unicorns lived in Germany...</p><p class="article__body-text">He did not spend long enough in Britain to observe much about its people, other than that they were nimble charioteers who, “without provocation”, attacked the army that was invading them.</p><p class="article__body-text">He said the Belgians were the bravest of the Gaulish peoples. He thought this was because they were the “least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale”. He may have been referring to Roman wine, which was so popular with other Gauls that an amphora of it might be bartered for a slave. This was a staggering price, implying that to a rich Gaul a good drink was worth a lifetime of someone else’s labour.</p><p class="article__body-text">Incidentally, Romans were sniffy about the Gaulish habit of drinking wine neat, instead of mixing it with water like civilised people. Arriving in Lutetia (“a town of the Parisii [tribe], situated on an island in the [River] Seine”), your correspondent checked to see if this barbaric custom persists. Happily, it does.</p><h2>The Swiss roll</h2><p class="article__body-text">The war began with a migration crisis. Nationalists today often describe an influx of migrants as an “invasion”. This one really was. The Helvetii, a tribe from what is now Switzerland, “felt that their territory was unduly small”. They burned their own villages so they could not retreat, packed three months’ supply of flour and rolled their wagons into Transalpine Gaul, a Roman province in what is now the south of France.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/xmas-edition-images/XMD070.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">Caesar saw his chance. Or, as he put it, “He saw that it would be very dangerous to the Province to have a warlike people, hostile to Rome, established close to its rich cornlands.” (Caesar always referred to himself in the third person.) He crossed the Alps, thrashed the Helvetii at the battle of Bibracte and deported the survivors—110,000 of the 368,000 original migrants.</p><p class="article__body-text">Over the next nine years, he conquered Gaul, an area that covers most of modern France and stretches as far east as the Rhine. He also fought the Germans and briefly invaded Britain. He was a superb strategist, methodical in securing supplies, and a deft forger of alliances. Yet he did not always win. <em>The Economist</em> visited the site of his most famous defeat.</p><p class="article__body-text">It was at Gergovia in 52<small>BC</small>. Vercingetorix, a young chief of the Arverni, had roused several Gaulish tribes to join a revolt. His victory has been celebrated in French art and literature, on Gauloises cigarette packets and by the indomitable Gauls in the Asterix books.</p><p class="article__body-text">Looking up at his hilltop fortress, one can see why Vercingetorix won. It is, as Caesar puts it, “situated on a high mountain and difficult of access on every side”. Gaulish warriors “occupied all the mountain heights within view and presented a terrifying appearance”.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Roman wine... was so popular with other Gauls that an amphora of it might be bartered for a slave</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar set up two camps: a big one on flat ground, and a smaller one on a hill below the Gaulish fortress. His men dug a long, deep trench to connect the two camps, so that legionaries could “pass to and fro... without fear of being surprised by the Gauls”. From the second camp, Caesar launched his main attack.</p><p class="article__body-text">On a sunny October Sunday, your correspondent climbed the same mountain path, stopping first to buy bread and goat’s cheese—rations any legionary would have recognised. As in Caesar’s day the slope is steep and rutted. Loose stones trip the unwary. Round every corner is a bush in which an archer might lurk. Even without armour, the hike was arduous. Under a hail of javelins it would presumably have been worse.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">After an hour, dripping sweat and feeling that he had earned his monthly bag of salt, your correspondent reached the foot of the battlements. There he was greeted not by blood-drenched Gaulish warriors, but by a French family with two small children having a picnic. They were there partly for the splendid view, they said, and partly to learn about history. The children debated which Asterix book was the best: “Asterix the Legionary” or “Asterix and Cleopatra”?</p><p class="article__body-text">On top is the Museum of Gergovia, which opened in 2019. Visitors wander around the plateau, where helpful signs explain who camped where and who slaughtered whom. Inside are exhibits describing what modern archaeology has added to Caesar’s account.</p><p class="article__body-text">The ditch connecting the two Roman camps is as Caesar described. Excavations in the 1990s found parts of it. In cross-section, the older soil is paler; the soil that filled it over subsequent centuries forms a dark triangle. Numerous artefacts have been unearthed: cracked helmets, short stabbing swords and huge arrows fired from a “scorpion”, a Roman siege crossbow.</p><p class="article__body-text">In his own account of the battle, Caesar is an ingenious tactician. He has mule-herders don helmets and pretend to be cavalry, to distract the Gauls’ attention. He moves soldiers quietly through his ditch to surprise them. He loses largely because of bad luck. Some of his men fail to hear a trumpet ordering them to fall back at a crucial moment. Others mistake their allies, from another Gaulish tribe, for Vercingetorix’s men.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar clearly downplays the scale of his defeat. He claims to have lost 700 soldiers, including 46 centurions. Since he fielded somewhere between 20,000 and 45,000 men and suffered a rout, this seems unlikely, notes Frédéric Nancel, the head of the museum. Caesar shifts blame onto his subordinates, for advancing farther than he had ordered them to. In a speech after the battle he chides his men for their “bad discipline”.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>What can we learn from Caesar, besides a greater scepticism of the self-serving words of the powerful?</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">How many of his excuses are true is unknowable. What we do know is that he regrouped and beat Vercingetorix later that year at Alesia, another hilltop fortress. For centuries historians debated where Alesia was. But in 1839 a Latin inscription was found near Alise Sainte-Reine, a town in Burgundy. It read “ <small>IN ALISIIA</small>”. In the 20th century photos from the air confirmed evidence of the siege lines that Caesar built around the plateau. Modern 3 <small>D</small> laser scanning, which can detect stone structures beneath soil and foliage, has enabled archaeologists to map where Caesar’s fortifications stood. Visitors can see a partial reconstruction, including ditches with spikes in them.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar says he was joined at the siege by Titus Labienus, who had just conquered Lutetia. Recent digging confirms this: a lead sling pellet has been found with his name on it. Such inscriptions were common and often crude, “aimed at predictable parts of the anatomy”, as Mary Beard, a historian, puts it in her book “ <small>SPQR</small>: A History of Ancient Rome”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Strangely, the museum at Alesia is bigger and older than the one at Gergovia. Nations usually pay more attention to their victories than their defeats—Waterloo station is in London, not Paris. But Caesar’s conquest was so long ago that modern French people feel no rancour about it, notes Stéphanie Focé, who works at the museum in Alesia. Indeed, many see themselves, correctly, as descendants of both Romans and Gauls.</p><h2>Gallic symbol</h2><p class="article__body-text">Napoleon III, France’s emperor from 1852 to 1870, tried to borrow the mystique of both Caesar and Vercingetorix. He paid for digs at Gergovia and Alesia, and erected a huge bronze of Vercingetorix near where the Gaulish chief made his last stand. Its face is modelled on Napoleon III’s. On the plinth is a quote Caesar attributed to Vercingetorix: “Gaul united, forming a single nation, animated by a common spirit, can defy the universe.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Stirring stuff. But Caesar could not have heard the speech from which the alleged quote is taken. Also, Gauls in those days did not refer to themselves as Gauls; it is a Roman word. Vercingetorix would have referred to specific tribes, such as the Arveni and Mandubii. Thus, Caesar made up a quote to make his enemy sound more impressive and thereby buttress his legally dubious claim to rule the Roman world. Two millennia later another coup leader, Napoleon Bonaparte’s nephew, twisted the fake quote to make himself seem like the embodiment of ancient Gallic glory.</p><p class="article__body-text">Groups of children and pensioners at Alesia enjoy relearning history. Gauls did not all sport huge moustaches, and they did not eat many wild boars, says Ms Focé. But they may have eaten dogs. Sorry, Obelix.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar’s dispatches were not received uncritically in Rome. Cato, a senator who detested him, said the tribes whose women and children he had killed should put him on trial. Pliny the Elder, an author, later accused him of a “crime against humanity”.</p><p class="article__body-text">But many Romans were impressed by his exploits. He had brought great swathes of land under Roman control. He had also looted a vast fortune (a fact his dispatches strangely neglect to mention). And he commanded 40,000 loyal, battle-hardened troops, which rather strengthened his hand. Had he relinquished his command, his enemies would no doubt have put him on trial. Instead, in 49<small>BC</small>, he marched a legion across the Rubicon river and into Italy.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Four years of civil war ensued. Caesar beat Pompey and became dictator. He never called himself “king”, a dirty word in Rome, or emperor. But his triumph marked the end of the Roman republic, which is why a gang of senators stabbed him to death in 44<small>BC</small>. He never said “ <em>Et tu, Brute</em>?” That was Shakespeare’s line. His adopted heir, Augustus, became the first emperor.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar’s legacy is immense. He shaped the political geography of Europe. He ensured that French words such as <em>liberté</em>, <em>égalité</em>, <em>fraternité</em>, <em>vin blanc</em> and <em>croissant</em> all have Latin roots. He gave the world a calendar that more accurately reflects the time it takes Earth to go around the sun and that is still used. Today only two days are named after Jesus Christ, but Caesar and his heir each have a whole month. The words “kaiser” and “tsar” derive from his name. So, as the comedian Eddie Izzard has pointed out, does Cesar, a brand of food for “small yappy-type dogs”.</p><p class="article__body-text">What can we learn from Caesar, besides a greater scepticism of the self-serving words of the powerful (especially when they talk of martial glory)? His world was distant from our own, and in many ways horrible. Babies were abandoned on rubbish heaps; children toiled in silver mines; slavery was taken for granted. Yet Rome had virtues, too.</p><p class="article__body-text">It was open to talent from anywhere. Conquered peoples became Roman citizens. As in the modern European Union, any citizen could travel and work throughout a continent-sized polity. This is a crucial reason why so many ended up welcoming Roman rule, and why the empire lasted so long.</p><p class="article__body-text">There was social mobility. Freed slaves could become rich and powerful. At least one emperor, Diocletian, is thought to have been born in shackles. Other emperors hailed from modern-day Libya, Serbia and Spain. Romans were rude about barbarians, but paid no heed to skin colour.</p><p class="article__body-text">Caesar often broke the law. But we can say this only because Rome had written laws. In other ancient polities, the law was whatever the chief said, so long as it did not too blatantly violate tribal custom. For most people in the Roman world, written laws made it easier to deal with strangers, and made life more predictable. Many politicians today undermine the rule of law, from Hungary and Russia to Brazil and America. Voters should recall that when the western Roman empire collapsed five centuries after Caesar, the lawless ages that followed were not pleasant.</p><p class="article__body-text">A final lesson from classical times is not to duck hard decisions. One reason why Caesar was able to seize power was that Roman commanders were responsible for providing their veterans with pensions. Thus the legionaries who spent nine years fighting for Caesar in Gaul had a huge financial stake in his future grip on power. They were loyal to him, not Rome.</p><p class="article__body-text">This is a terrible system, as the citizens of countries where private militias run rampant today, from Iraq to Myanmar, can attest. Augustus ended it by making the central government responsible for military pensions. It cost a fortune: more than half the annual tax revenue of the empire, by one estimate. But it brought peace. Today’s leaders, who run and hide at the first mention of pension reform (never mind a carbon tax), should pay heed. <em>Carpe diem</em>. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ILLUSTRATIONS: R.
