But it is rare for the margin of victory to swing by 13 percentage points. Republicans accomplished that feat in Virginia on Tuesday night when Glenn Youngkin, a businessman and political newcomer, beat Terry McAuliffe, a former governor, gathering roughly 51% of the vote to Mr McAuliffe’s 48%. It was the first time Republicans have won the state’s governorship since 2009.</p><p class="article__body-text">A number of factors led Virginia’s voters to Mr Youngkin, a former chief executive of the Carlyle Group, a private-equity firm. The most obvious was the Democrats’ unpopularity nationally. Joe Biden’s job approval at this stage in his presidency is worse than that of any of his predecessors save Donald Trump. According to <em>The Economist</em>’s polling with YouGov, the share of Americans who disapprove of Mr Biden is six percentage points higher than the share who approve of him: a net rating of minus six.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden, and by proxy Mr McAuliffe, is especially unpopular among political independents, who vote in droves in the suburban and exurban counties of Virginia that ring Washington, DC. Though blue overall, these counties—particularly Loudoun and Fairfax, home to Mr Youngkin—swung hardest against the Democrats.</p><p class="article__body-text">Our analysis of precinct-level returns from the governor’s race suggests the Democrats lost roughly five points of vote share where they are traditionally strongest, and about the same amount where Republicans tend to dominate. But the Democrats lost nearly ten points in the marginal counties that decide Virginia elections. There, many voters switched from backing Mr Biden last November to supporting Mr Youngkin.</p><p class="article__body-text">Low turnout hurt Mr McAuliffe, too. Relative to the last election, the number of votes cast this year was lowest in the most Democratic counties. In the reddest areas of the state, turnout was about 60% of the level it was a year ago, whereas in the bluest places it struggled to hit 50%. This suggests Mr Youngkin’s victory came not only because he won over a surprising number of soft Democrats and independents, but also because the Democratic base did not show up.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr McAuliffe clearly knew of his troubles within his party weeks ago, and his campaign tried desperately to energise the dawdlers. His last-minute statewide Get Out The Vote tour featured appearances by Mr Biden, Barack Obama and the Dave Matthews Band, an inexplicably popular soft-rock outfit from Charlottesville—home to the University of Virginia, in the centre of the state.</p><p class="article__body-text">Each candidate’s approach relied on elements of his party’s national message. Mr McAuliffe tried to yoke Mr Youngkin to Donald Trump, while Mr Youngkin warned Virginia parents that his opponent would indoctrinate their children with leftist dogma about race and gender. In the end it is hard to say exactly what mattered the most. Precinct-level results reveal only so much about how people felt about the candidates. One exit poll from CNN showed 51% of voters thought parents should have “a lot” of say over what is taught in schools, and of those voters 76% favoured Mr Youngkin. But 50% also thought the economy was going poorly, and nearly the same proportion of those voters went for Mr Youngkin.</p><p class="article__body-text">The Virginia result is likely to confirm Republicans in their dismal conviction that waging culture war is the way to win. For their part, Democrats now confront urgent questions about how to increase turnout among their supporters in the cities and persuade independents and soft partisans in less dense areas. Those demographic trends tend not to change quickly, and may be harbingers of losses for the Democrats in the mid-term elections next year.</p></div></body></html>
