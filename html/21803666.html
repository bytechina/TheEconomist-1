Some 750,000 of them were sold in the first quarter of 2021 according to <small>JATO</small> Dynamics, a British consultancy. <small>JATO</small> reckons <small>EV</small>s now account for just over 4% of new-car sales, up from 2% in the same quarter last year. Yet many potential buyers still suffer from “range anxiety”, a wariness about having to interrupt a long journey while an <small>EV</small>’s battery is recharged.

But a number of producers and their component suppliers are now gearing up to introduce 800<small>V</small> drive systems. Higher voltages supply the same amount of power with less current, which means electric cables can be made lighter—the consequent weight saving helping to increase a vehicle’s range, says Christoph Gillen, a technology director for <small>GKN</small> Automotive, a British components group which recently announced that it is accelerating its development of 800<small>V</small> drive systems. As most cabling is made from <a href="./people-may-one-day-drill-for-copper-as-they-now-drill-for-oil.html">copper</a>, the price of which has been soaring, this should also save carmakers money.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">What drivers are most likely to notice, though, according to Dr Gillen, is that vehicles with 800<small>V</small> drive systems will be able to make greater use of some of the latest fast chargers. For instance, Ionity, a German company backed by a number of carmakers, is building a network of 350k<small>W</small> fast chargers across Europe. These automatically optimise charging speed to the maximum that a vehicle can handle. Using one of these, an <small>EV</small> with an 800<small>V</small> system will be able to recharge about twice as quickly as a similar vehicle with a 400<small>V</small> system.</p><p class="article__body-text">Fast chargers are also more efficient. All chargers take electricity from the grid, which uses an alternating current (<small>AC</small>). When an <small>EV</small> is plugged into a standard charging point, its systems convert <small>AC</small> into direct current (<small>DC</small>), which is what a battery needs to store electricity. Fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter, using their own beefier bits of kit to pump a <small>DC</small> charge directly into the battery.</p><p class="article__body-text">The first <small>EV</small> to use an 800 <small>V</small> drive system was the Porsche Taycan, a luxury sports saloon. This was launched in 2019. According to Porsche, by using a fast-charger the Taycan’s huge 93k <small>W</small>h battery can, in a little more than five minutes, gather enough juice for the car to travel 100km.</p><p class="article__body-text">Two South Korean producers, Hyundai and its partner Kia, launched their first 800<small>V</small> vehicles this year. Kia says the 77k<small>W</small>h battery in its <small>EV</small>6, which went on sale on August 2nd, can be recharged from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes. (The last 20% of capacity is charged at a slower rate in most <small>EV</small>s, to prevent damage to the battery. Hence a full recharge is typically carried out overnight on a standard charger.) Others have 800<small>V</small> vehicles in the works, too. They include General Motors, Volvo, <small>BYD</small> and Stellantis (a large shareholder in which, for full disclosure, also has a stake in <em>The Economist</em>’s parent company).</p><h2>Angst and amps</h2><p class="article__body-text">Turning an <small>EV</small>’s battery from a 400<small>V</small> to an 800<small>V</small> system is fairly straightforward. Principally, it involves wiring up more of the battery’s cells in series. But the associated electronics need additional re-engineering. The main reason why the current generation of <small>EV</small>s use 400<small>V</small> is that semiconductors able to handle higher voltages have not been readily available.</p><p class="article__body-text">Now that <small>EV</small> sales are growing strongly, though, specialist chipmakers are investing in <a href="./21803287.html">semiconductors</a> that can operate at 800<small>V</small>. Instead of using transistors made from pure silicon, those employed by these chips are made from silicon carbide, which is more robust. Safety systems in vehicles, such as automated circuit breakers which isolate the battery in the event of a crash, also need to be upgraded.</p><p class="article__body-text">What all this means is that, as more 800<small>V</small> <small>EV</small>s come onto the market, and batteries continue to improve with increased capacity, more motorists are likely to be persuaded to go electric. Much, however, will depend on the availability of fast-charging infrastructure. If stations are easy to find, and topping up batteries takes only the amount of time required to pick up a coffee, then the malady of range anxiety will at last be laid to rest. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on August 18th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "Pump up the voltage!"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=New%2C%20800V%2C%20electric%20cars%2C%20will%20recharge%20in%20half%20the%20time&amp;publicationDate=2021-08-19&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fl8qrrq4vmac4lhavk1stu1553oon6eel&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
