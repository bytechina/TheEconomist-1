The bridge, one of only two main routes into or out of the city across the Dnipro river, was rendered impassable on July 27th by Ukrainian soldiers, who are fighting to retake Kherson from Russian forces. They used a handful of missiles fired from an American-supplied <a href="./ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army.html"><small>HIMARS</small></a> launcher, which relies on global positioning system (<small>GPS</small>) signals to find their target. <small>GPS</small> is a powerful tool of war, but it can often be rendered useless by the enemy. What could Russia do to prevent more strikes of this kind? <br/><br/>The NavStar Global Positioning System was developed by America’s air force in the 1970s. It was the first system to provide portable, accurate navigation anywhere on earth. The receiver picks up precise time signals from several satellites and calculates its position by triangulation. <small>GPS</small>-guided munitions have almost completely replaced unguided bombs in <a href="./the-pentagon-sharpens-its-cultural-sword-to-win-future-wars.html">America’s arsenal</a>. Many other weapons, from missiles to artillery shells, are also <small>GPS</small>-enabled. Much of Ukraine’s older <a href="./the-west-has-a-chance-to-wean-india-off-russian-weaponry.html">Russian-made weaponry</a> is not so advanced. But America and other backers are providing <small>GPS</small>-guided rockets and artillery shells. The technology is expensive but almost guarantees a hit, assuming the target is stationary and its location is known. <br/><br/>But <small>GPS</small> can be vulnerable. The satellites that power it are around 20,000 kilometres from Earth, but their transmitters are no more powerful than a car’s headlight. Their weak signals can be drowned out by radio transmitters operating on the same wavelengths. Some are harder to jam than others. Military <small>GPS</small> receivers may use “M-code”, a military-only signal. Some receivers have electronic filters to separate signals from noise, and directional antennas to pick up only signals from satellites. American <a href="./america-sends-advanced-missiles-to-help-ukraine-fend-off-russia.html">weapons</a>, such as <small>HIMARS</small> rockets, also have back-up inertial guidance, which measures acceleration and uses it to extrapolate distance and direction of travel. This kicks in if <small>GPS</small> fails to guide the missile. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Still, Dana Goward, president of the Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, an advocacy group, and a member of America’s government advisory board on <small>GPS</small>, reckons that Russia could do more to prevent precision strikes in Ukraine. It may be holding back on jamming to keep some capability in reserve for a possible conflict with <small>NATO</small>, he says. A high-powered jammer is the radio equivalent of a lighthouse, making it a very visible target. Some Russian forces may even be using <small>GPS</small> instead of <small>GLONASS</small>, their own equivalent (but less reliable) technology. Britain’s defence minister, Ben Wallace, has said that some Russian pilots are taping commercial <small>GPS</small> receivers to their instrument panels.<!-- --> The Kremlin may have decided to limit jamming to avoid disrupting its own forces.</p><p class="article__body-text">Russia is also capable of rendering <small>GPS </small>satellites completely useless, either using a cyber or physical attack. But it is highly unlikely to take such a dramatic step simply to impede Ukrainian strikes. An attack on <small>GPS</small> would be an attack on America, and thus risk drawing <small>NATO</small> into the conflict. Nevertheless, to counter such a threat, America has long been developing alternatives to satellite navigation. In June it tested a system called <small>RATS</small> on a B-2 bomber. Most systems of this kind use the plane’s radar to precisely find its location by comparing the ground below it with a map, a form of the “terrain contour matching”, or <small>TERCOM</small>, used by cruise missiles for decades. Meanwhile, as Ukraine receives more <small>GPS</small>-guided rocket launchers from America and Britain, Russia may increase its jamming efforts. But for the time being, satellite-guided munitions are still hitting targets with impressive precision. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-is-the-american-right-obsessed-with-viktor-orban.html">Why is the American right obsessed with Viktor Orban?</a><br/><a href="./how-do-prisoner-swaps-work.html">How do prisoner swaps work?</a><br/><a href="./how-crowdfunding-is-shaping-the-war-in-ukraine.html">How crowdfunding is shaping the war in Ukraine</a></p></div></body></html>
