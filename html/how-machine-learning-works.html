In 1958 the <em>New York Times</em> reported that the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/machlearning-001/lecture/249">Perceptron</a>, an early AI machine developed at Cornell University with military money, was "the embryo of an electronic computer that [the American Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence". Five decades later, self-aware battleships remain conspicuous by their absence. Yet alongside the hype, there has been spectacular progress: computers are now better than any human at the games of chess and Go, for instance. Computers can process human speech and read even messy handwriting. To many people today, automated telephone-response systems are infuriating. But they would seem like magic to someone from the 1950s. These days AI is in the news again, for there has been impressive progress in the past few years in a particular subfield of AI called machine learning. But what exactly is it?</p><p class="article__body-text">Machine learning is exactly what it sounds like: an attempt to perform a trick that even very primitive animals are capable of, namely learning from experience. Computers are hyper-literal, ornery beasts: anyone who has tried programming one will tell you that the difficulty comes from dealing with the fact that a computer will do exactly and precisely what you tell it to, stupid mistakes and all. For tasks that can be boiled down into simple, unambiguous rules – such as crunching through difficult mathematics, for instance – that is fine. For woollier jobs, it is a serious problem, especially because humans themselves might struggle to articulate clear rules. In 1964 Potter Stewart, a US Supreme Court judge, found it impossibly difficult to set a legally watertight definition of pornography. Frustrated, he famously wrote that, although he could not define porn as such, "I know it when I see it." Machine learning aims to help computers discover such fuzzy rules by themselves, without having to be explicitly instructed every step of the way by human programmers.</p></div></body></html>
