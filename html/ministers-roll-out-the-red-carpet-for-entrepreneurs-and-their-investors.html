The government-backed British Business Bank will receive £1.6bn ($2.2bn) to allocate to its regional funds, which provide debt and equity capital for fledgling businesses. The Global Britain Investment Fund—which invests in life sciences, offshore wind and car manufacturing—gets a £1.4bn boost. A further £150m goes to a fund that aims to rebalance geographical inequalities in access to early-stage equity capital.</p><p class="article__body-text">All of this is dwarfed by a pledge to raise government spending on research and development (<small>R&amp;D</small>) to £20bn a year by the end of the parliamentary term, in 2024. After adjusting for inflation, that represents an increase of around a quarter from current levels. It is sorely needed. Britain’s gross <small>R&amp;D</small> expenditure was 1.8% in 2019, compared with an average of 2.5% in the <small>OECD</small>, a club of mostly rich countries. Most of the difference is due to lacklustre <small>R&amp;D</small> spending from Britain’s private sector compared with its international peers. But the Treasury hopes that more public funds will spur greater private investment as well.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Accompanying the extra money was an early warning of an attempt to muscle firms into spending more of it at home. Of the £47.5bn of <small>R&amp;D</small> for which companies claimed tax relief in 2019, only £25.9bn was carried out in Britain. Noting that countries like America and Australia do not offer similar rebates for <small>R&amp;D</small> performed overseas, the government promised to “refocus the reliefs towards innovation in the <small>UK</small>.”</p><p class="article__body-text">As well as handing out cash, the chancellor set about reassuring startup founders and their investors that long-held gripes would be dealt with. One of these is a cap on the fees workplace pension schemes can pay to investment managers. Designed to protect retirement savings from outsized investment charges, it also limits pension schemes’ ability to invest in things like infrastructure and early-stage companies, due to the performance fees charged by venture capital funds. Treasury officials will now consult on loosening the cap.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another is access to foreign talent, which is set to be liberalised next spring. A new visa programme will allow those with a job offer from a fast-growing British firm to migrate with few strings attached. A second will make graduates of top universities eligible for visas, even if they do not have a job offer. It is time for startup lobbyists to come up with a new wish-list.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Something ventured"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Ministers%20roll%20out%20the%20red%20carpet%20for%20entrepreneurs%20and%20their%20investors&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-30&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fks23m34jppqvl4rfb5o4q8km174tmoim&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
