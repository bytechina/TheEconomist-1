These vaccines cannot be administered orally, since the m<small>RNA</small> would be quickly destroyed by acids in the stomach.</p><p class="article__body-text">Aware of these challenges, Robert Langer and Giovanni Traverso, engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<small>MIT</small>), wondered if it might be possible instead to smuggle m<small>RNA</small> into the stomach inside a protective capsule that is engineered to jab patients from the inside, where they would feel nothing.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This is not new ground for the researchers. Several years ago they collaborated to create a star-shaped structure that could be folded up inside a capsule and then released when the capsule dissolved in the stomach. Once free, the structure remained in the stomach for a month, slowly releasing contraceptives, malaria drugs or <small>HIV</small> treatments as needed by a patient.</p><p class="article__body-text">With this in mind, Dr Langer and Dr Traverso wondered whether they could design something that could linger in the stomach and then inject its medication there.</p><p class="article__body-text">The device they invented is the size of a large pill, encased in gelatine and shaped like the shell of a tortoise. It carries a needle that is engineered to penetrate the lining of the stomach only when the device’s flat section sits flush against it. So aligned, the needle can then inject its payload painlessly into the stomach wall.</p><p class="article__body-text">The researchers knew, however, that this trick alone would not be enough for safe passage of the delicate molecules. Naked m<small>RNA</small> is not readily taken up by cells, but needs to be encased inside a protective envelope to gain entry.</p><p class="article__body-text">The m<small>RNA</small> molecules of covid-19 vaccines are delivered into cells inside tiny bubbles of fat. But the sort of delivery mechanism needed for Dr Langer’s and Dr Traverso’s device was not immediately clear. To investigate further, the engineers worked with colleagues at <small>MIT</small> to test several hundred specially shaped polymers that they thought might be able to protect their m<small>RNA</small> molecules as they transferred into stomach cells. They found three polymers that could carry the m<small>RNA</small> payloads successfully and also support a transfer into living cells.</p><p class="article__body-text">The engineers loaded these polymer-encased m<small>RNA</small> molecules into their turtle-shell pills, which were then swallowed by six mice. As expected, they subsequently found evidence that the m<small>RNA</small> had transferred successfully into the stomach tissue of all the mice.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The researchers then went on to test their technology on pigs, which have stomachs that are very similar to those found in humans. They introduced their turtle-shell pills into three animals and studied their stomachs a day later. Two showed clear evidence of the m<small>RNA</small> having entered their cells. One did not.</p><p class="article__body-text">Dr Traverso and Dr Langer published details of their work this week in the journal <em>Matter</em>. Their device shows the potential to get m<small>RNA</small> into the body without the need for an uncomfortable jab in the arm.</p><p class="article__body-text">More work is needed, however, both to understand why one trial in the pigs failed to yield results and also to work out if the m<small>RNA</small> molecules like those found in covid-19 vaccines can also be successfully delivered via something like Dr Langer’s and Dr Traverso’s turtle-shell pills. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>To enjoy more of our mind-expanding science coverage, <a href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Simply Science</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "Trypanophobics rejoice!"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20new%20way%20to%20deliver%20delicate%20drugs%2C%20no%20jabbing%20required&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-05&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F0fcabff0vcddvfcnt8st05hu8usprbin&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
