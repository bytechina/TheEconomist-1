Two months to the day after protesters <a href="./sri-lanka-has-no-money-and-no-government-what-now.html">clashed with government-supported goons</a> on the seafront in Colombo, Sri Lankans returned to their capital in a display of rage. “Gota go home,” they chanted, using the popular nickname for Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the president. He had clung on in May, <a href="./21809223.html">sacrificing his brother</a>, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the prime minister, instead. This time, the protesters got their wish.</p><p class="article__body-text">It was unclear, in the run-up to the weekend, whether protesters would make it. The previous day, police had declared a curfew. Trains and other public transport were cancelled. The telecoms regulator told phone companies to turn off data services (they didn’t). Thousands of members of the security forces were deployed to guard Fort, the heart of the city. In any case, there is no fuel—how were people supposed to get to Colombo?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">They walked. Many had set out on foot from distant towns and villages the previous day and marched through the night. Others piled into the few vehicles still functioning: lorries, buses, even tractors. By Saturday afternoon an angry sea of humanity covered every inch of space outside the presidential Secretariat. Lawyers in black coats and nurses in white frocks chequered the crowd. University students came out in huge numbers. Many carried the flag of Sri Lanka. As they stormed Gota’s official residence, they lowered the presidential flag and hoisted the national standard. In a country with deep ethnic divisions, and a 26-year-long civil war to show for them, the government’s catastrophic ineptitude had served to bring Sri Lankans of all stripes together. </p><p class="article__body-text">Sri Lanka, as Ranil Wickremesinghe, the prime minister, said earlier in the week, is “bankrupt”. In May it defaulted on its <a href="./21808728.html">foreign debt</a>. It has all but run out of petrol and will soon run out of diesel. Queues for fuel stretch for kilometres, with minimum waiting times of around three days. Without fuel, there is no transport, and without transport food cannot reach cities. There is no money for imports. Shop shelves are emptying. Many people who until a few months ago would have been comfortably middle-class are now skipping meals. </p><p class="article__body-text">Schools in and around the capital are closed, government offices get Fridays off and the private sector is barely functioning. The health sector is collapsing. Doctors can’t get to work. Medicines are running short; so are supplies like sutures. Hospitals have been forced to cancel surgeries. </p><p class="article__body-text">By late afternoon the protesters controlled the centre of the city. They made themselves tea in the presidential kitchen, lounged on the presidential bed and swam in the presidential pool. The mood was one of elation—a mix between storming the Bastille and going on a field trip. Gota had fled the house the previous day.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In the suburbs of Colombo, the mood was sombre. At a meeting at the Speaker’s residence (and on Zoom), party leaders considered what to do next. The solution was obvious: the government had to go. Shortly before 7pm local time, Mr Wickremesinghe said that he would “accept the best recommendation of the party leaders today, to make way for an all-party government” and resign. </p><p class="article__body-text">That was not enough for the protesters. Mahinda and other Rajapaksa brothers had taken the hint after the May protests. Yet Gota had clung on, either convinced of his own popularity—he is a war hero who brought the civil strife to a bloody end—or in the belief that only he can see the country through the crisis. Pictures of him and the prime minister having a laugh in Parliament on July 5th reinforced Sri Lankans’ conviction that nothing would change with him in charge. Negotiations with the IMF for a bailout are making progress, but not fast enough to satisfy an angry and humiliated population. </p><p class="article__body-text">At the same meeting that produced Mr Wickremesinghe’s promise of resignation, party leaders also called for Gota to go. The speaker would then act as president for a maximum of 30 days while Parliament picked an MP to do the job for the remainder of Gota’s term, which lasts until 2024. An interim all-party government would be in charge of running the country and dealing with the IMF, with a plan to hold early elections. </p><p class="article__body-text">Gota said nothing throughout the day. Yet the longer he stayed silent, the darker the mood became. Though nobody has been killed, more than 55 people have ended up in Colombo National Hospital, despite the protests remaining mostly peaceful. By nightfall that had started to change. In a rerun of May’s violence, the prime minister’s private residence was set on fire. At around 10pm local time, the president at last recognised that it was over. He told the speaker he would resign four days hence, on July 13th. Almost immediately, the mood lifted. It was firecrackers, now, that Sri Lankans were setting alight. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
