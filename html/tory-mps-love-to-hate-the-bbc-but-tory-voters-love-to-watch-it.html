Winston Churchill suspected that the broadcaster was “run by reds”.

The licence fee, an annual charge on households which provides most of the corporation’s income, will be frozen at £159 ($217) for the next two years. That was expected; more surprising was her declaration on Twitter that the current licence-fee agreement, which runs until 2027, would be the last. Ominously for the <small>BBC</small>, the government has no plan yet for what might replace it.</p><p class="article__body-text">The announcement was billed as “red meat” for Tory <small>MP</small>s, who are alarmed at the party’s recent dive in the polls. They cheered as Ms Dorries demanded that the <small>BBC</small> shun “groupthink”. But bashing the <small>BBC</small> has become politically trickier for the Conservatives. The main losers from cuts to its output are its increasingly elderly viewers, who also make up a growing share of the Tory vote.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Older people have long been somewhat more likely than youngsters to vote Conservative, but in the past decade they have become hugely so. Whereas in 2010 the Tories’ vote share among over-65s was 14 percentage points higher than among under-25s, in 2019 the party won 64% of the pensioners’ vote, versus just 19% among the younger group.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1267/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/01/articles/body/20220122_brc032.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220122_brc032.png" srcset="../image/20220122_brc032.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">As the Tory coalition has gone grey, so has the <small>BBC</small>’s audience (see chart). Young people are moving away from television in general and the <small>BBC</small> in particular, while the elderly remain super-consumers of both. Over-65s watch more than six hours of video a day, about a third of it from the <small>BBC</small>, according to Enders Analysis, a research firm. The typical 16- to 24-year-old watches a little under four hours, of which the <small>BBC</small> provides only around 15 minutes. Factoring in the <small>BBC</small>’s full range of services—radio, online and more—the under-35s consume about an hour of <small>BBC</small> content a day. That is less than half as much time as pensioners spend watching <small>BBC TV</small> alone.</p><p class="article__body-text">Since every household pays the same licence fee, the elderly get the best deal out of the <small>BBC</small>. Indeed, 1.5m poorer households with a resident over 75 are exempt from the fee altogether, courtesy of a waiver funded by younger licence-fee payers.</p><p class="article__body-text">What deal could be better for the corporation’s elderly, Tory-voting viewers? It is hard to think of one. Some Conservatives back a subscription model, along Netflix lines. Yet younger households would probably opt out, meaning the <small>BBC</small>’s remaining subscribers would lose the subsidy they currently get from those who are forced to contribute despite seldom tuning in.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another idea is to make the <small>BBC</small> rely on advertising. Thatcher planned to do this until her advisers concluded that it would devastate commercial media. Today, even the <small>BBC</small>’s fiercest critics in the press shudder at the thought of competing with it for ads. Perhaps simplest would be to fund the public broadcaster directly from the public purse. Yet Tory backbenchers might find a new <small>BBC</small> tax hard to swallow.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">As more households switch to streaming and the <small>BBC</small>’s share of screen time declines, the licence fee will become harder to justify. And the Tories are not the only ones with axes to grind. Many in Labour consider the <small>BBC</small> incorrigibly conservative; Remainers and Leavers alike were annoyed by aspects of its Brexit coverage; nationalist parties in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have an in-built scepticism towards the London-based broadcaster. But for now the Tories may find it most convenient to leave the licence fee alone. That way their voters can continue to enjoy the twin pleasures of complaining about the <small>BBC</small>’s iniquities while settling down for a long, subsidised night in front of the box. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em><a href="./the-parable-of-boris-johnson.html">The parable of Boris Johnson</a> (Jan 22nd)<br/></em><em><a href="./21807270.html">Boris Johnson’s broken premiership</a> (Jan 22nd)<br/></em><em><a href="./boris-johnsons-would-be-assassins-are-very-like-him.html">Boris Johnson’s would-be assassins are very like him</a> (Jan 22nd)<br/></em><em><a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/01/19/how-does-a-leadership-challenge-work-in-britains-conservative-party">How does a leadership challenge work in Britain’s Conservative Party?</a> (Jan 19th)<br/></em><em><a href="./boris-johnson-has-always-been-unfit-to-be-prime-minister.html">Boris Johnson has always been unfit to be prime minister</a> (Jan 15th)</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Telly addicts"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Tory%20MPs%20love%20to%20hate%20the%20BBC%2C%20but%20Tory%20voters%20love%20to%20watch%20it&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-22&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fq1fjr889cq0qu806kksi90g2ql5dsjaq&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
