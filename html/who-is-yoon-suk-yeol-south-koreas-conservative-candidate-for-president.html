Mr Yoon was South Korea’s chief prosecutor until March and only officially entered politics in June, when he said he would run for the presidency as an independent. In July he joined South Korea’s main opposition, the conservative People Power Party (PPP). In early November he won its presidential primary with 48% of the vote (his main opponent, Hong Jun-pyo, got 42%). He will face off against <a href="./south-koreas-ruling-party-bets-on-an-anti-establishment-figure.html">Lee Jae-myung</a>, the candidate for the governing Minjoo party, and a couple of minor candidates in the presidential election next March.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Yoon made his name as an aggressive prosecutor unafraid of harrying political bigwigs. He helped convict <a href="./south-koreas-president-is-permanently-stripped-of-her-powers.html">Park Geun-hye</a>, a conservative former president now serving a long prison sentence, for abuse of power. His commitment to running the prosecuting authority as an <a href="./south-koreas-president-wants-to-take-politics-out-of-prosecutions.html">independent institution</a> endeared him to President Moon Jae-in—like Mr Lee, of the Minjoo party—who appointed him as prosecutor-general in 2019. That he then spent most of his term confronting senior Minjoo officials, most prominently two justice ministers, endeared him to the PPP as it cast around for a candidate to renew the party’s credibility after the impeachment scandal. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Fittingly, Mr Yoon says that his presidential run is motivated by a desire to rebuild the rule of law, which he claims the current administration has undermined (he has been quiet about PPP’s run-ins with the law). He has not specified how he plans to do this, though presumably it would involve rolling back some of the reforms Mr Moon has instituted. Mr Yoon’s views on other key policy issues are similarly hazy. At a press conference on November 12th, he promised to “neutralise” the threat from North Korea by building up the South’s defence capacity while also attempting to engage the North with the aim of opening up its economy. He gave scant detail of how this might be achieved. Nor has he presented clearly worked-out plans for tackling South Korea’s increasingly unaffordable housing without penalising existing homeowners. </p><p class="article__body-text">So far the support of PPP members has ensured Mr Yoon’s rapid ascent. But he is less popular with the public, who preferred Mr Hong as a potential candidate. Political inexperience may continue to dog him. He made a string of gaffes during the primary campaign, accidentally publicising his belief in shamanistic practices and being forced to walk back comments that were read as downplaying the crimes of Chun Doo-hwan, South Korea’s most brutal military dictator. The PPP will hope that Mr Yoon’s credentials as a tough prosecutor will outweigh his lack of political savvy and that advisers can help him build a credible platform before the election. He may also benefit from voters’ desire for a change after five years, particularly if he becomes less gaffe-prone as the campaign wears on. The coming months will show whether the heat of a presidential campaign forges or melts him.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-is-india-clinging-to-coal.html">Why is India clinging to coal?</a><br/><a href="./why-it-matters-that-magnesium-is-in-short-supply.html">Why it matters that magnesium is in short supply</a><br/><a href="./who-is-sara-duterte-the-philippine-presidents-daughter-running-for-office.html">Who is Sara Duterte, the Philippine president’s daughter running for office?</a></p></div></body></html>
