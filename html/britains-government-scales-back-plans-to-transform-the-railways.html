Four days later the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> and five other northern newspapers ran almost identical front pages depicting Boris Johnson and his cabinet as characters from Danny Boyle’s 1996 film “Trainspotting” and telling them to “deliver what you promised”. Politicians are thick-skinned and will not mind being compared to heroin addicts. The accusation that they have betrayed the north is more troubling.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/667/90/media-assets/image/20211120_WOM937.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211120_WOM937.png" srcset="../image/20211120_WOM937.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The north and Midlands had been promised High Speed 2, a new Y-shaped railway connecting Birmingham, Leeds, London and Manchester (see map). The north had also been led to expect a second high-speed line running east-west, from Leeds to Liverpool. What it got, in the government’s railway plans published on November 18th, is a severely truncated high-speed scheme and several unexciting but worthwhile improvements to the existing railway network. The government has broken its promises. It has also inadvertently revealed what the Conservative Party’s favourite phrase, “levelling up”, actually means. </p><p class="article__body-text">The pruning of HS2 was almost inevitable. That grand project was initially misconceived and has been badly managed. It was sold to MPs and the public as a whizzy scheme that would allow business travellers to zip between big cities, making them more productive. Because it is built to carry extremely fast trains, the line has a high engineering specification, driving up its cost. The fragile coalition government led by David Cameron from 2010 to 2015 made matters worse by caving in to southern NIMBYs who wanted the line to run through tunnels for long stretches. HS2 was originally projected to cost £37.5bn in 2009 prices (then $60bn). A review in 2019 estimated the project would come in between £72.1bn and £78.4bn in 2015 prices. Even that sum seemed several tens of billions too low. </p><p class="article__body-text">Under the new plan, as under the old one, a high-speed line will run from London to Manchester via Birmingham. But the eastern section of the Y, from Birmingham to Leeds, has been cut back to a spur. The high-speed line will stop a few miles south of Nottingham; from there, fast trains will have to join the existing line. As a result, a journey from Leeds to London will take 113 minutes, up from 81 minutes in the previous plan (but down from 133 now). Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative MP long sceptical of HS2, calls it “a white elephant missing a leg”. </p><p class="article__body-text">The proposed new east-west line from Leeds to Liverpool, known as Northern Powerhouse Rail, has also been pruned. Although 40 miles of new high-speed track will be built in the western section, trains will revert to the existing line in Yorkshire (additional tracks will be added in some sections to allow them to overtake each other). Manchester will not get an underground railway station, as local politicians wanted. The line will not run through Bradford, whose 540,000 people are poorly served by rail and road at the moment. </p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Some of the money thus saved will be spent on improvements elsewhere. The transport department promises new digital signals, more convenient pay-as-you-go ticketing and funding for a metropolitan transport system in Leeds. The proportion of Britain’s railway network that is electrified will rise from the current 38%. The government even claims that some medium-sized cities and towns will benefit from the pruning of HS2. Under the previous plan, the line would have bypassed Derby and Nottingham, forcing residents of those cities to change trains if they wanted to use the high-speed line. Now that HS2 has been scrapped in that region, the trains will travel to them along existing, upgraded lines. </p><p class="article__body-text">Although it was hardly audible above the cries of betrayal, the government put forward an intriguing case for its new plan. “The old plans got the balance wrong,” explained Mr Johnson. They focused too much on showpiece high-speed links and too little on local services—“less glamorous, perhaps, but more important to most people”. The new plan, he claimed, “helps our largest cities, but it also helps smaller places.” The prime minister cited an MP who said that his constituents would rather have a decent bus service to the next town than watch trains zooming by at 200mph without stopping. Furthermore, the new plans can be delivered more quickly than the previous ones. </p><p class="article__body-text">This is a poor analysis of Britain’s transport needs. The real point of building new high-speed railway lines, as ministers ought to have said much more loudly a decade ago, is to remove fast trains from the existing network. Once they are gone, it should be possible to run many more local trains—those unglamorous things that improve ordinary people’s lives. It would also be possible to run more freight trains, which would remove lorries from the roads. Odd as it might seem, a new railway line can improve local transport even if the nearest stop is many miles away. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">As a political pitch, though, it is revealing. Mr Johnson talks often about “levelling up” Britain without explaining what he means. The new railway plan provides some clarity. Levelling up is not about grand projects but about marginal improvements that people will notice. It is less about enhancing the productivity of knowledge workers in big cities than about making life more convenient for town-dwellers. It emphasises quick benefits over long-term economic transformation. This might seem a rather pinched vision of Britain’s future. But Britain is a rather pinched country these days. </p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%E2%80%99s%20government%20scales%20back%20plans%20to%20transform%20the%20railways&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fav520hu7p11ulhhufsukpmbfjs5p1oe3&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
