Yet the way her fortunes turned at the <small>US</small> Open, with one mistake begetting another, turns out to be common. A recent paper by David Harris, Samuel Vine and Mark Wilson of the University of Exeter and Michael Eysenck of Royal Holloway University of London finds that top-tier tennis players are surprisingly prone to mistakes caused by situation-driven anxiety—implying that this tendency may be too fundamental for coaching to cure it.</p><p class="article__body-text">The taxonomy of shots in tennis helps to isolate the impacts of consistency and risk appetite. When a player misses a routine shot and loses a point, it is scored as an “unforced error” (<small>UE</small>). Conversely, shots that bounce within the court without being touched by an opponent are “winners”.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="20210911_GDC202_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">The study analysed the rates of both <small>UE</small>s and winners among nearly 400,000 points from tennis’s four leading events in 2016-19. In high-pressure contexts such as break and set points, <small>UE</small>s were 15% more common than under less stressful conditions. Similarly, during points following <small>UE</small>s, the chances of a repeat blunder rose sharply. These effects reinforced each other, so that <small>UE</small>s were even more common during high-pressure points following a prior <small>UE</small> than you would otherwise expect.</p><p class="article__body-text">Moreover, <small>UE</small>s’ habit of bunching together narrowed the performance gap between players. Logically, players who went on to win matches had a lower <small>UE</small> rate than their rivals did. But this disparity shrank from three percentage points overall to two following <small>UE</small>s. Under high pressure after <small>UE</small>s, it dwindled from seven points to four.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The rate of winners was unchanged by pressure. It did rise after <small>UE</small>s, implying that players may try to make up for mistakes by putting away the next point decisively. Nonetheless, the gap in winner-to-<small>UE</small> ratios between matches’ eventual victors and losers was smaller on points after <small>UE</small>s than in other contexts. The authors argue that <small>UE</small>s raise awareness of the risk of failure. This could expose players who go on to win matches to the mental state felt more often by losers, causing hiccups in their play.</p><p class="article__body-text">The paper bolsters a growing body of research on athletes’ psychological vulnerabilities. Other studies have found that basketball players’ free-throw percentage dips in the final minutes of close games, and that golfers are more likely to miss putts that have an unusually large impact on prize money. Athletes are often hailed as exemplars of mental toughness. But for everyone else who occasionally succumbs to anxiety, it may be reassuring to know that you are in good company.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text" data-interactive-class="g-interactive-source">Source: “Psychological pressure and compounded errors during elite-level tennis”, by D.
