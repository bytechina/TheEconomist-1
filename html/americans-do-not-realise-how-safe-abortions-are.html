Although most Americans think <a href="/graphic-detail/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-abortion-ruling-will-outrage-most-americans">women should be allowed a termination in some circumstances</a>, public debate on the issue has become increasingly fraught.

According to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group, the share of terminations carried out with pills rose from 39% in 2017 to 54% in 2020 (the latest year for which data are available). That does not include the illicit market for these drugs, meaning the rate is probably even higher. And it has almost certainly risen further since. In April 2021 the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would allow abortion pills to be mailed to patients for the duration of the pandemic. The image of women walking into abortion clinics to end a pregnancy, though highly politicised, is only part of the picture.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1258/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1258/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/197/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/295/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/393/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/590/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/629/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/786/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/983/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1258/90/media-assets/image/20220604_WOC541.png 1280w"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">It still has a grip on the popular imagination, nonetheless. According to a recent survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of <i>The Economist</i>, 38% of Americans reckoned that surgical termination was most common. Only 14% of respondents thought most abortions were performed with medication. A political divide exists too. Both Democrats and Republicans underestimated the prevalence of medication abortions, but Republicans were further off the mark. Only 13% said medication was the most common method compared with 21% of Democrats (the share of Trump voters who thought so was as low as 8%). </p><p class="article__body-text">Respondents in Europe had a better understanding of the procedure. In Britain, where 65% of abortions are carried out with a pill, 42% of respondents correctly identified it as the most common method. Although the French, Swedes and Danes all underestimated the prevalence of medication abortion in their countries, they too were far closer than the Americans.</p><p class="article__body-text">Americans are also ill-informed about the safety of abortions—again, more so than their European counterparts. A study in 2015 by researchers at Planned Parenthood and Princeton University found that only 0.01% of women who took abortion pills experienced complications that required hospitalisation. This number is comparable to—or by some estimates slightly lower than—the frequency of problems arising from surgical abortions. Yet just 14% of Americans polled by YouGov considered medication abortions to be “very safe”, and a plurality was unsure about their reliability. Respondents were twice as likely to consider surgical abortions very safe. Those polled across six European countries rated both medication and surgical abortion as safer than Americans did.</p><p class="article__body-text">Friday’s decision means states now have the power to draft <a href="/by-invitation/2022/06/22/abortion-would-be-best-governed-by-legislatures-says-o-carter-snead">their own abortion legislation</a>. At least 13 will implement “trigger laws” to restrict access to the procedure; eventually, the Guttmacher Institute reckons, more than half of America’s states may ban abortion. In the fraught and never-ending debate over how women end pregnancies, lawmakers should remember that most of them simply take two pills with a glass of water, and that the process is remarkably safe. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__body-text"><b>Read more on this topic:</b><br/>Daily chart: <a href="/graphic-detail/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-abortion-ruling-will-outrage-most-americans">The Supreme Court’s abortion ruling will outrage most Americans</a><br/>The Economist Explains: <a href="/the-economist-explains/2022/05/03/why-abortion-rights-are-under-threat-in-america">Why abortion rights are under threat in America</a><br/>By Invitation: <a href="/by-invitation/2022/06/13/overturning-abortion-rights-ignores-freedoms-awarded-after-slaverys-end-says-peggy-cooper-davis">Overturning abortion rights ignores freedoms awarded after slavery’s end, says Peggy Cooper Davis</a><br/>Summer reads: <a href="/economist-reads/2022/06/21/the-best-books-to-explain-americas-debate-on-abortion-rights">The best books to explain America’s debate on abortion rights</a></p></div></body><script>
