Satellite footage showed it was hauling some back while pushing others forward. The White House warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine was still on the cards. Vladimir Putin said diplomacy should continue. Russia’s tame parliament passed a bill urging Mr Putin to recognise two breakaway statelets in eastern Ukraine. Since these statelets claim big chunks of Ukraine they do not control, this would give Mr Putin a pretext for war. He said he would not sign the bill yet. The Kremlin insisted, absurdly, that Ukraine was committing genocide against Russian-speakers. Hackers attacked Ukrainian banks and the defence ministry.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">France, its European allies and Canada said they would withdraw their troops from <a href="./france-withdraws-its-forces-from-mali.html"><strong>Mali</strong></a>.
