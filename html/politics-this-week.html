Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas and an advocate of vaccines, said the government’s order “disrupts and divides” America. With only 54% of the population fully vaccinated, Joe Biden thinks mandates are essential. Companies will have to ensure their employees are either jabbed or tested weekly. All federal workers as well as staff in health facilities that receive government money will have to be vaccinated.</p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="./how-britain-plans-to-co-exist-with-covid-19.html">In Britain</a> the government reversed course and said that <strong>vaccine passports </strong>for large events would not go ahead. The roll-out of vaccine boosters for over-50s will start, however, to help reduce pressure on the health service. Jabs will also be offered to 12- to 15-year-olds, a controversial move; the official vaccine committee has said the benefit from a health perspective is too small, but the government insists that inoculations will limit disruption to schools.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Gavin Newsom easily defeated a statewide ballot, bankrolled by conservative groups, to boot him out of office as governor of<strong> California</strong>.

It is not clear whether the prosecutor had the authority to make such a request, or whether Mr Henry had the power to sack him. He also fired the justice minister.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>UN</small> warned of an alarming increase in violence in the east of the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>. It has recorded 1,200 deaths and 1,100 rapes this year by militias in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Mali’s</strong> government is close to reaching a deal to hire 1,000 Russian mercenaries to train its army and protect senior officials. France, which has a large counter-terrorism mission in the country, has suggested it will withdraw its troops if the deal goes ahead.</p><p class="article__body-text">After 13 months of political paralysis, <strong>Lebanon</strong> got a new government.
