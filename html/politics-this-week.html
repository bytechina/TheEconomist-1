Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, said he would support raising the limit until December, avoiding a sovereign default as early as October 18th. As a condition, he wants Democrats to raise the borrowing cap by a fixed amount, rather than suspend it altogether until some future time. December may bring another round of brinkmanship.</p><p class="article__body-text">A federal judge blocked an <strong>abortion law </strong>passed in Texas that allows anyone in America to sue anyone who helps someone in the state abort a fetus older than six weeks.
