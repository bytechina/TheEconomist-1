Mr Castillo must select a new foreign minister by the end of the month, when Congress will vote on whether to accept his cabinet.</p><p class="article__body-text">The government of <strong>Cuba </strong>laid out laws tightening its control of social media.

His Liberal Party hopes to win more than the 170 seats necessary for an outright majority in the country’s Parliament.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>France</strong> became the latest European country to suffer from dangerous <strong>wildfires</strong>, as a large area near the south coast had to be evacuated. <strong>Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey </strong>have all been badly affected by blazes as well.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Israeli firefighters</strong> battled one of the largest <strong>wildfires </strong>in the country’s history.
