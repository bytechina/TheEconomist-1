But forming a new government will probably take many weeks, as it will almost certainly involve a three-party coalition. Olaf Scholz, the <small>SPD</small>’s candidate for chancellor, is the most probable successor to Angela Merkel, at the head of a “traffic-light” coalition including the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, though this is by no means guaranteed. Armin Laschet, who led the Christian Democrats to their worst-ever defeat, is facing pressure to resign, but insists he still has a chance to construct his own coalition.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Iceland</strong> fell short of having Europe’s first parliament where women hold most of the seats, following a recount after its election.
