But more than 40% of his own <small>mp</small>s voted against him, severely denting his authority. The party’s rules prevent another formal challenge to Mr Johnson’s leadership for a year.

Six months later, she quit. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Sweden’s</b> governing Social Democrats won what was in effect a no-confidence vote, but only by securing the co-operation of an independent <small>mp</small> of Kurdish descent by reaffirming their support for a Kurdish group in Syria.
