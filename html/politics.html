It criticised the government’s initial approach as “fatalism …seeking to manage, but not suppress, infection”. Britain subsequently suffered an egregiously high death rate.</p><p class="article__body-text">Several Asian countries announced plans to loosen pandemic-related border controls. <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Singapore</strong> will start allowing fully vaccinated visitors from low-risk countries to enter without quarantine, <strong>Malaysia</strong> said it would allow its citizens to travel abroad again, and <strong>India</strong> will restart issuing tourist visas for all passengers. <strong>Sydney</strong> ended 107 days of lockdown.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>G20</small> held a meeting to discuss the economic situation in <strong>Afghanistan</strong>.

Some of Mr Sadr’s rivals are backed by Iran.</p><p class="article__body-text">President Joe Biden considered imposing sanctions on parties to <strong>Ethiopia’s</strong> civil war, which he was ready to discuss with Uhuru Kenyatta, his Kenyan counterpart.
