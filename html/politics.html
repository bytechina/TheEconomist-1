After a stand-off with law-enforcement officers he was shot dead by a border-patrol agent. Parents were asked to provide <small>dna</small> samples to help identify the children’s bodies. The perpetrator had a semi-automatic rifle and wore body armour, as did the gunman who shot and killed ten black people at a supermarket in Buffalo on May 14th. It was the worst <b>school shooting</b> in America since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. The <small>fbi</small> reported this week that the number of “active shooter” incidents, not counting episodes of gang violence or domestic disputes, rose by more than 50% last year to 61. </p><p class="article__body-text">Eric Adams, the mayor of <b>New York</b>, came under pressure to improve safety on the city’s subway system, and throughout the city generally, after a Goldman Sachs worker was shot dead on a train in a seemingly chance encounter.

Mr Trump wanted to oust Brian Kemp as governor in the primary as revenge for his refusal to overturn the presidential election result in the state in 2020 (Mr Trump’s wild notion that the election was stolen rests in large part on losing Georgia). Mr Kemp’s victory means he will face the Democrats’ Stacey Abrams in a re-match for governor in November. Four years ago Ms Abrams claimed Mr Kemp suppressed the black vote in order to win. </p><p class="article__body-text">A judge suspended the Biden administration’s reversal of a pandemic health measure that allows for the swift expulsion of <b><a data-tegid="p32tp2a9763jo8mn32s3crumgcu0nmua" href="./the-title-42-furore-highlights-americas-broken-immigration-system.html">illegal migrants</a></b> back across the Mexican border.

The report also indirectly criticised Boris Johnson, the prime minister, for “failures of leadership and judgment”. </p><p class="article__body-text">A judge in <b>Argentina</b> agreed to a deal that means the president, Alberto Fernández, will pay a donation to a vaccine-research institute so that legal proceedings against him for allegedly breaching lockdown rules are dropped.
