In an excruciating appearance before the House of Commons the British prime minister struggled to explain why he attended a bring-your-own-booze get-together in Number 10’s garden in May 2020, when people were allowed to meet only one other person outdoors. He described it as a “work-related” event.

Many observers suspected the violence stemmed from a power struggle between Mr Tokayev and Nursultan Nazarbayev, his predecessor and patron. Russia said that order had been largely restored and it would start pulling back its troops.</p><p class="article__body-text">A court in Germany sentenced Anwar Raslan, a former <strong>Syrian</strong> colonel, to life in prison for crimes against humanity. Mr Raslan was linked to the torture of more than 4,000 people at a prison in Syria. He had sought refuge in Germany after defecting from the Assad regime. It was the world’s first criminal case involving state-sponsored torture in Syria.</p><p class="article__body-text">David Sassoli, the president of the <strong>European Parliament</strong>, died from complications following a bout of pneumonia.

It added that half of Europe could catch Omicron within two months.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi</strong>, Myanmar’s de facto leader until a coup last February, was found guilty by a military court of breaking covid rules and possessing walkie-talkies. She was sentenced to four years.

A pair of bills under consideration would make election day a holiday, and give the federal government more power to step in if states try to limit methods of voting, such as postal ballots. Mr Biden said Senate Democrats would stop Republicans from filibustering the legislation.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>California’s</strong> governor, Gavin Newsom, laid out a plan that would extend Medicaid, a federal-state health-insurance programme for hard-up people, to illegal immigrants, regardless of age.
