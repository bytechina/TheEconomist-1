The dollars began flowing in 2002, when the justices let states provide parents with vouchers for religious schooling. In 2017 the court said states may not exclude church-based preschools from grants for playground resurfacing. And in 2020, in <em>Espinoza v Montana Department of Revenue, </em>parents persuaded the high court that their state must provide tuition assistance for students to attend religious schools if they also offer these funds for secular private schools.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-supreme-court-seems-ready-to-poke-a-hole-in-the-church-state-wall.mp3" title="The Supreme Court seems ready to poke a hole in the church-state wall"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">On December 8th the justices contemplated taking another brick out of the “wall of separation between church and state”—Thomas Jefferson’s spin on the First Amendment’s bar on laws “respecting an establishment of religion”. The case, <em> Carson v Makin</em>, is a challenge from parents who say Maine is violating their religious liberty. About half of Maine’s school districts have too few students to support a high school. The fix is a programme whereby students attend public schools in other districts or, using state funds, opt for private schools. But there is a catch: Maine’s money may go only to schools whose curriculums are “nonsectarian”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Last year the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Maine’s policy, citing a distinction in the <em>Espinoza </em>decision. That ruling said it is unconstitutional to rope religious schools out of state benefits based on their “status”, or religious affiliation. But declining money for religious “use”—mandatory prayer, say—is another question, which <em>Espinoza</em> left open. Maine’s nonsectarian rule addresses the character of curriculums, not whether schools have a religious identity, the First Circuit found, so did not violate the constitution.</p><p class="article__body-text">The families’ lawyer, Michael Bindas, scoffed at this distinction. It is “baseless” and contrary to “common sense”, he told the justices, to bar one type of bias while permitting another. Limiting tuition payments to secular private schools is “discrimination based on religion”. A secular-only rule violates the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious free-exercise.</p><p class="article__body-text">The six conservative justices signalled strong agreement. Many of their questions for Mr Bindas were aimed at allaying fears that striking down Maine’s policy will open state coffers to all manner of church funding. Imagine a state wants to pay for facility improvements at public and private schools, Chief Justice John Roberts asked, but tells sectarian schools the money cannot be used to build a chapel. “Is that <small>OK</small> or not?” It’s probably fine, Mr Bindas replied. A state may have a compelling interest in declining to give “direct institutional aid” for a religious project.</p><p class="article__body-text">Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh tried to degrease the slippery slope, too. “You’re not arguing”, Justice Kavanaugh asked, “that the mere funding of public schools would entitle the parents to funding for religious schools”, right? “That is correct,” Mr Bindas replied. “We are not arguing that there is a constitutional right to a publicly funded religious education, nor could we.” The right to equal access to state support kicks in only when a state decides to fund private schools.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">As in recent oral arguments on abortion and the right to bear arms, the three liberal justices were outnumbered. They tussled with Mr Bindas on several points. Justice Elena Kagan pressed a question of standing: since the schools involved have not said they will accept students who use state money, do the parents even have the legal right to sue? And Justices Kagan, Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor challenged Mr Bindas’s framing of the case. Maine’s policy serves “a very small number of students living in isolated areas”, Justice Kagan noted. The benefit, Justice Sotomayor said, is “a free public secular education”. All parents have the right to pay to send their child to a religious school but why, Justice Kagan asked, “does the state …have to subsidise the exercise of a right?”</p><p class="article__body-text"><em>Carson</em> reignites a debate over what remains of Jefferson’s wall of separation. The partition no longer means, as the court held in 1947, that “no tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called.” More recent rulings have afforded states some sway to avert strife by avoiding entanglements with religious institutions. “Other people won’t understand”, Justice Kagan said, “why in the world their taxpayer dollars are going to discriminatory schools.” Yet that seems to be what the court is about to require in Maine and beyond. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Following the money in Maine"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20Supreme%20Court%20seems%20ready%20to%20poke%20a%20hole%20in%20the%20church-state%20wall&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-09&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fu208ui39adcsttadqd6kntp3fpsrss46&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
