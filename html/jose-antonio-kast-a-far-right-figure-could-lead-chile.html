He had hoped to be the grave-digger. But in the first round of the presidential election on November 21st he came second to José Antonio Kast, a far-right candidate, who defends the free-market institutions that have shaped the economy since the Pinochet dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Kast is the narrow favourite to win the run-off, scheduled for December 19th.</p><p class="article__body-text">He won 28% of the vote, compared with Mr Boric’s 26%. For the first time since the return of democracy, candidates from the established parties of the centre-left and centre-right did not make the run-off. What the two finalists have in common is that they reject the centrist consensus that has held sway since the dictatorship, though in very different ways. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The centrists guided Chile to stability and prosperity but came to be seen as unresponsive to citizens’ demands. A new middle class demanded better pensions, education and health care. The gulf in income between rich and poor remained wide. Voter turnout fell sharply after voting became voluntary in 2012, and is today among the lowest in Latin America. (Just 47% of the electorate turned up in this week’s first round.) Large demonstrations took place in 2006, 2011 and 2016. They culminated in an uprising in 2019, whose violence took most Chile-watchers by surprise. This year Chileans elected an assembly whose task is to make society and the economy more just by writing a new constitution.</p><p class="article__body-text">Messrs Boric and Kast are heirs of this decade of discontent. Mr Boric, now 35, was a leader of student protests in 2011. The coalition he now leads includes the Broad Front, itself a coalition that emerged from the protests. Its ideology is similar to that of Spain’s Podemos, a left-wing anti-austerity party, and resembles the viewpoint of millennial “progressives” on the left of America’s Democratic Party, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman. It favours a much bigger economic role for the state and is preoccupied with racial and gender inequality. Mr Boric’s programme calls itself “feminist” and green. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Kast could hardly be more different. He defends Pinochet’s legacy and reviles the social and economic changes sought by the left. In 2017 he left a coalition of established right-wing parties because they were adopting the “slogans of the new left”. His popularity has surged in recent weeks because of fears about rising migration and crime. His strongest support came from northern provinces through which most illegal immigrants enter the country, and from southern provinces in which some indigenous Mapuche groups are fighting a low-level insurgency against the state. Mr Kast’s programme takes aim at Mr Boric’s generation of student leaders, “daring” voters to create a Chile where “children respect their parents'' and “students are subordinate to their teachers”. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In legislative elections, held on the same day as the first presidential round, left-wing parties and their allies lost their majority in the Senate and seats in the 155-member lower house. Mr Kast’s coalition, which formally registered to compete at national level just five months ago, won 15 lower-house seats and one in the Senate--more than several established parties. The Communists, allied with Mr Boric, also won a record number of seats. To enact legislation, the next president will have to strike deals with a broad range of parties.</p><p class="article__body-text">The near-tie between Messrs Kast and Boric gives extra influence to the losing candidates. The most closely watched will be Franco Parisi, an economist with a colourful history who came a surprising third, with 13% of the vote. His Party of the People won six seats in Congress’s lower house. He rails against the “political caste” on his YouTube channel (where he hosts a show called “Bad Boys Who Make the Elite Uncomfortable”). Mr Parisi attracts voters who identify as neither left- nor right-wing. He talks tough on immigration but is economically liberal.</p><p class="article__body-text">He is literally an outsider candidate, having conducted his campaign via social media from Birmingham, Alabama, where he lives. Among his excuses is that he faces political persecution In Chile. He also faces an arrest warrant because he allegedly owes more than $200,000 in child-support payments to his ex-wife, who lives in Chile. His lawyer says he doesn’t owe any money. Mr Parisi intends to conduct a poll of his supporters online to determine which candidate to back. Given his outlook, they are likely to endorse Mr Kast.</p><p class="article__body-text">The second-round contest is likely to push both Mr Kast and Mr Boric towards the political centre. Sebastián Sichel, a centre-right candidate who got nearly as many votes as Mr Parisi, said he “will not vote for Boric” and is ready to negotiate with Mr Kast. In his victory speech Mr Kast put out feelers to Yasna Provoste, the centre-left candidate. She rebuffed him, saying “we cannot allow the advance of the fasciscm that Kast represents.” Although the moderates lost, they will continue to help shape Chilean politics.</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Kast%2C%20a%20far-right%20figure%2C%20could%20lead%20Chile&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-23&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F4tj0mrr6u7hpj38burlofpa8kdkir367&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
