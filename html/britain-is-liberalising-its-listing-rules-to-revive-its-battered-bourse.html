Its share of global initial public offerings (<small>IPO</small>s) has fallen from 20% to 4%, and since a peak in 2007 the number of companies listed on it has fallen by two-fifths. Two government-sponsored reviews published early in 2021 made recommendations intended to arrest this decline. On December 3rd the Financial Conduct Authority (<small>FCA</small>) brought the most important of these into force.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/britain-is-liberalising-its-listing-rules-to-revive-its-battered-bourse.mp3" title="Britain is liberalising its listing rules to revive its battered bourse"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Companies with “dual-class” shares that grant directors outsized voting rights will now be able to join the premium segment of the London Stock Exchange (<small>LSE</small>). Dual-class listings will be permissible if designed to protect fledgling firms from hostile takeovers. The extra voting rights must concern only the removal of a director or change of control, and expire after at most five years. Firms with such share structures will no longer be restricted to the standard segment, meaning that they will be included in the <small>FTSE</small> indices. That will allow passive funds that track indices to buy their shares, broadening their investor base and increasing liquidity.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But violating the “one share, one vote” principle long regarded as sacred in the City has provoked criticism. Richard Buxton of Jupiter Asset Management wrote in the <em>Evening Standard</em> that it would “reduce investor protection and sow the seeds of scandal and losses”. In March several fund managers publicly refused to participate in the <small>IPO</small> of Deliveroo, a food-delivery firm, citing its dual-class shares as a reason.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such opposition is misguided, says Anne Glover, who co-wrote one of the reviews, because “in the early stages of company development, its founders and directors are simply likely to understand the development opportunity better than the general investor.” And dual-class shares are favoured by the high-growth, founder-led tech companies the government wants to entice to list in the City. They are beloved of American tech stars that became global giants, from Google and Facebook to Slack and Airbnb.</p><p class="article__body-text">More importantly, says Ms Glover, dual-class shares protect founders from losing control of their company in the early days after listing. This can be valuable while founders are still learning to communicate their strategy to the market, and especially so given the complex requirements for disclosure that listing brings. The <small>LSE</small>’s chief competitors in America, Hong Kong and Singapore all offer this protection, without downgrading the companies that use it. Britain’s dearth of listings has been in part due to its failure to do the same.</p><p class="article__body-text">Three groups stand to benefit from the change. The first is investors in British shares, because firms with dual-class shares tend to generate higher returns. An analysis by <small>MSCI</small>, a provider of stockmarket indices, found that between 2007 and 2017 North American companies with unequal voting rights outperformed those with equal rights by 4.5% per year. Some of this was because many tech firms have dual-class shares, and the sector fared particularly well. But mostly, it was down to differences between individual companies, suggesting that the concentration of voting power in itself boosted returns.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The second group to benefit will be companies with dual-class shares that listed on the <small>LSE</small>’s standard segment in recent years, among them Deliveroo, Oxford Nano pore and Wise. They may need to fine-tune their dual-class shares to qualify for the premium segment, but they now have a path to upgrading to a premium listing and inclusion in the <small>FTSE</small> indices, without losing protection against takeovers.</p><p class="article__body-text">The final beneficiaries—and the main motive for changing the rules—are companies that might list in London one day. The <small>FCA</small> has also decreased the proportion of its shares a firm must make available to the public in order to list, from 25% to 10%. It hopes this will encourage founders and early investors who want to keep their shares to list their companies nonetheless.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some argue for further liberalisation. Dominic Hallas of Coadec, a tech lobbyist, points out that the five-year limit on dual-class shares sends an odd message to founders looking at the outperformance of firms with permanently unequal voting rights. But after a long time lagging behind its rivals, Britain’s stockmarket is moving in the right direction. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Dual carriageway"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%20is%20liberalising%20its%20listing%20rules%20to%20revive%20its%20battered%20bourse&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-09&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F1ibhk4iqhdb9bkuc21cp0qnt5phsg27n&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
