At issue is whether or not Digital World and Trump Media had agreed to merge prior to Digital World raising money from investors.</p><p class="article__body-text">A <small>SPAC,</small> also called a blank-cheque company, is a special kind of financial vehicle. It is a shell company that raises money from investors by going public, and then seeks out a private company to merge with. There are fewer disclosure requirements for firms which end up public via merger, rather than making their debut via initial public offering. This offers firms picked by <small>SPAC</small> bosses an easier path to going public.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It is important that the <small>SPAC</small> is independently created and chooses the firm, and not vice versa. A freshly minted <small>SPAC</small> boss ought to seek out the best possible firm it can to usher into public markets. But a firm that seeks out or encourages the creation of a <small>SPAC</small> for the purpose of taking it public is trying to pull off pure regulatory arbitrage. This tends to irk regulators.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are two reasons to suspect that Digital World and Trump Media may have pre-arranged their merger. The first is just how quickly it came to pass. Most <small>SPAC</small>s hunt for months, sometimes more than a year, to find a target. Digital World raised $288m on September 8th and announced the merger with Trump Media six short weeks later, on October 20th.</p><p class="article__body-text">The second is that Patrick Orlando, now the boss of Digital World, was apparently talking to Mr Trump’s representatives about a deal as early as April, according to the <em>New York Times.</em> In papers filed with the <small>SEC</small> on May 25th, Digital World said it had neither picked nor “initiated any substantive discussions” with a merger target. Around July, before Digital World’s fundraising, a Trump Media executive said the firm was in an “exclusive agreement” to merge with an unidentified <small>SPAC.</small></p><p class="article__body-text">At the time Mr Orlando was the boss of numerous <small>SPAC</small>s. He could have been representing any one of them on the call with Mr Trump’s representatives. And even if he did mislead investors in his regulatory filings, they have hardly been shafted. Shares in Digital World jumped from $10 to $109 on news of the Trump Media deal (though they have since traded between $40 and $70, which would value the merged firm at about $5bn-10bn). Indeed, investors clamoured for more. On December 4th Digital World raised a further $1bn from unnamed institutional investors.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">That will be little comfort to regulators, who may intervene. Allowing <small>SPAC</small>s to be created as vehicles for specific firms is a great way to create a backdoor that lets the flimsiest ones into public markets. Trump Media is a manifestation of that idea. The scant information on Trump Media’s website leaves it unclear who, if anyone, is working on building its social-media platforms. The only product discussed is <small>TRUTH</small> Social, seemingly a Trump-friendly version of Twitter. But the test version of the site is just a cut-and-paste of the open-source code for Mastodon, another social-media platform. The firm was apparently without a chief executive until December 6th when Devin Nunes, a particularly bovine member of Congress, announced he would step down to run the firm. <em>Caveat emptor</em> doesn’t really cover it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of Joe Biden’s presidency, visit our dedicated <a href="./page-not-found.html"> hub</a> and follow along as we track shifts in his <a href="https://econ.st/3BCgX9s"> approval rating</a>.
