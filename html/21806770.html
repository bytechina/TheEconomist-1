Less than a mile from the observatory, its citizens can be seen tending fields and riding bicycles past a cluster of low-rise blocks of flats not far from the river bank.

The latest hope for opening and reform was dashed in Vietnam in 2019, when Mr Kim and Donald Trump, then America’s president, failed to come to an agreement to exchange sanctions relief for arms control at what was to be <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/02/28/donald-trump-and-kim-jong-un-leave-vietnam-without-a-deal">their final meeting</a>. Over the past two years, ever more of the few remaining links between North Korea and the outside world have been severed as Mr Kim has instituted one of the world’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/10/22/north-korea-is-lonelier-than-ever">strictest border closures</a> in response to the covid-19 pandemic. What little information trickles out is hardly encouraging: there are reports of severe food shortages and political purges, even as state media rebuff diplomatic overtures from America and the South.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">When Mr Kim took over upon the death of Kim Jong Il, his father, on December 17th 2011, such a grim state of affairs did not seem inevitable. Some observers at the time thought the regime would soon collapse, and economic opening under Chinese supervision would follow. Others, including this newspaper, doubted that Mr Kim would develop an appetite for serious reform but still assumed that he would be unable entirely to resist pressure for change. Both elites and ordinary North Koreans were increasingly cynical about the might of the state after witnessing its failures during the famine in the 1990s.</p><p class="article__body-text">For the first few years of Mr Kim’s tenure, predictions of improvement did not seem unrealistic. In a speech on the centenary of his grandfather’s birth, in 2012, the rookie dictator laid out his plan to build an “economically powerful state” and “improve the people’s livelihood”. He reformed laws governing agriculture and state-owned firms to allow a degree of private enterprise in the economy, invited outside experts to advise him on setting up new special economic zones and awarded official status to hundreds of the country’s informal markets.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Kim also embarked on a binge of “socialist construction”, filling Pyongyang, the capital, with futuristic skyscrapers, water parks and a dolphinarium. And he set to work on new tourist infrastructure elsewhere in the country, notably at his summer retreat in Wonsan on the east coast. Trade with China picked up, driven largely by a new class of quasi-entrepreneurs operating from within state-owned firms.</p><p class="article__body-text">As a result, things visibly improved—albeit from a low level and mostly in the capital, where those with spare cash could enjoy well-stocked supermarkets and new coffee shops. Refugees from North Korea arriving in the South began to report different reasons for leaving the country, suggesting both economic improvements in places beyond Pyongyang and a growing awareness of life in the outside world. “In earlier years people would say they were fleeing to survive; now most say they fled for freedom,” says Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea, an <small>NGO</small> in Seoul that helps North Koreans reach the South.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Kim’s “father and grandfather built their identity around conflict, suffering and sacrifice,” says Jenny Town of the Stimson Centre in Washington. “He didn’t have that, so promising people a better life was an alternative way to build legitimacy.” Yet the boundaries of that “better life” have been gradually constricted in recent years. The point of it was to make Mr Kim’s rule more stable. It did not extend to allowing anything resembling a real market economy or granting more political freedoms to ordinary people.</p><p class="article__body-text">And it has been accompanied by heightened repression inside the country, tighter control of the borders and acceleration of the nuclear programme started by Mr Kim’s predecessors, notably through <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/07/08/north-koreas-long-range-missile-test-alarms-washington">tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles</a> which, North Korea claims, are capable of reaching America. The international economic sanctions imposed on the North to slow down the nuclear programme, which were strengthened in 2017 after those tests, left Mr Kim with little money to advance goals other than building up his arsenal.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Kim’s attempts to resolve that contradiction by courting Mr Trump and Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, ended in failure. During his meeting with Mr Trump in Hanoi, he miscalculated by demanding comprehensive sanctions relief from America in return for dismantling Yongbyon, an important but ageing nuclear plant. Mr Trump, who prides himself on his ability to drive a hard bargain (and has little patience for working-level talks), rebuffed Mr Kim, causing talks to collapse.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/12/articles/body/20211218_asc256.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211218_asc256.png" srcset="../image/20211218_asc256.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">That might have been manageable, since Mr Kim’s other diplomatic overtures in this period, notably to China, had slightly more success and ensured a steady flow of trade, both legal and illicit. But when the pandemic struck, Mr Kim’s response put paid to that, too (see chart). The border with China has been closed for the best part of two years. Despite recent rumours of a limited opening, it is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Tourism is moribund. Most foreign diplomats have left. Aid organisations are locked out, making it difficult for anyone to discern what is going on inside the country.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/08/27/as-natural-disasters-strike-north-korea-cuts-itself-off">hints of growing distress</a>, with even the privileged in Pyongyang suffering food shortages. Mr Kim himself has admitted that the food situation is “tense” and urged his people to prepare for hardship. But he has also increased penalties for smuggling, and for watching foreign entertainment such as South Korean dramas. He continues to rebuff offers of aid and even covid vaccines. Calls by South Korea and America to revive a spirit of detente, such as by negotiating a formal end to the Korean war, have gone unanswered.</p><p class="article__body-text">That suggests that Mr Kim has lost hope, at least for now, that building bridges with America and its allies can improve things, reckons Ms Town. He will probably shift his focus back towards relations with Syria, Iran and Venezuela, fellow pariahs to which North Korea has sometimes sold weapons to raise hard cash.</p></div><h2>If it ain’t broke...</h2><p class="article__body-text">Trade with China, too, is likely to resume, if slowly, as pandemic restrictions in both countries are loosened over the coming years. Western countries and South Korea may find themselves at the receiving end not of diplomatic outreach, but of ransomware attacks, cryptocurrency theft and espionage perpetrated by North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated state-sponsored cyber-criminals. Combined with current levels of political repression, such measures are likely to be enough to keep North Korea’s economy afloat.</p><p class="article__body-text">Given that even the grim status quo looks, for now, survivable, it will be hard to muster up enticements to coax Mr Kim back to the table to discuss arms control. Of 82 North Korea analysts polled recently by <small>NK</small> Pro, a research outfit based in Seoul and Washington, a plurality of 31 recommended that America should accept that persuading the paunchy dictator to give up his nuclear weapons was a lost cause, and engage in sustained diplomacy that is not contingent on his agreeing to renounce them. But there is little appetite for that among American politicians.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ten years on, the “economically powerful state” Mr Kim set out to build remains a mirage. He can at least console himself with his yachts and the continuing growth of his nuclear arsenal. His people, alas, have no such luxury. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on December 12th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "A decade of despair"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Ten%20years%20into%20Kim%20Jong%20Un%E2%80%99s%20rule%2C%20North%20Korea%20is%20more%20North%20Korean%20than%20ever&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-16&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F3h7hoomuue10ats5q9kh9vrmt5j3m147&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
