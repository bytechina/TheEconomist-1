Investors have long thought that Mr Dorsey was spreading himself too thin between Twitter and Square (soon to be renamed Block), a payments company that he will still lead. He was sacked as <small>CEO</small> in 2008, but returned to the job in 2015. Last year a hedge fund sought his removal, after Mr Dorsey said he wanted to spend some time in Africa. He once likened Twitter to a “global consciousness”. The job of running this universal system of awareness now falls to Parag Agrawal, the former chief technology officer.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Britain’s competition regulator looked to unwind a merger involving Big Tech when it directed <strong>Meta</strong>, the parent company of Facebook, to sell <strong>Giphy</strong>, a database of animated <small>GIF</small> files that social-media users attach to their posts. Both companies are American. The regulator concluded that Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy last year could concentrate Facebook’s market power in Britain, and also curtail Giphy’s potential to expand its own advertising services.</p><p class="article__body-text">A regional director of America’s National Labour Relations Board ordered <strong>Amazon</strong> to allow workers at a warehouse in Alabama a second vote on whether to unionise, finding that the company had “hijacked” the process. In April a closely watched vote on joining a union, the first at an Amazon centre in America, was overwhelmingly rejected by employees. Amazon might appeal to the full <small>NLRB</small> against the decision to hold a re-run.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Nubank</strong> lowered the target share-price range for its forthcoming <small>IPO</small> in New York. The Brazilian fintech firm, Latin America’s most valuable startup, could still be valued at $42bn, placing it above Brazil’s biggest bank in terms of market capitalisation. Meanwhile <a href="./21806548.html"><strong>Grab</strong>, a “super app”</a> offering a wide range of services and based in Singapore, prepared to make its stockmarket debut on the Nasdaq exchange by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company.</p><h2>Omigod, Omicron</h2><p class="article__body-text">Markets were unsettled by <a href="./what-the-omicron-variant-means-for-the-world-economy.html">the potential for Omicron to hamper economic recovery</a>. Global <strong>stockmarkets</strong> plunged after South Africa announced that it had discovered the latest strain of covid-19, and remained febrile. <strong>Oil prices</strong> also swooned on the prospect for reduced demand. Brent crude fell to $70 a barrel, from $82.</p><p class="article__body-text">Jerome Powell also spooked markets when he said it was time to drop the word “transitory” from the Federal Reserve’s statements on <strong>inflation</strong>. The central bank’s chairman admitted that the risk of higher inflation had increased, and indicated that he would support a quicker pace of monetary-tightening measures.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <strong>euro zone’s</strong> average annual rate of inflation rose to 4.9% in November, the highest it has been since the creation of the single currency more than 20 years ago, adding more pressure on the European Central Bank to start winding down its stimulus programme. In Germany inflation stood at 6%, a level not seen since the aftermath of reunification three decades ago.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <strong>Australian economy</strong> expanded by 3.9% in the second quarter over the same three months last year, but shrank by 1.9% compared with the previous quarter. Melbourne and Sydney ended their extensive pandemic lockdowns only in October.</p><h2>Unorthodox</h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/634/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211204_WWC062.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211204_WWC062.png" srcset="../image/20211204_WWC062.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">With the lira plunging to new lows, prompting another intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency, <strong>Turkey’s</strong> finance minister resigned, and was replaced with an ally of the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr Erdogan believes that his insistence on interest-rate cuts has created an economic boom: <small>GDP</small> grew by 7.4% in the third quarter, year on year. But the plunging lira and inflation of nearly 20% have made household goods much more expensive, leading to recent street protests.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>UN</small> reported that international <strong>tourist</strong> arrivals were up by 58% in July to September compared with the same three months last year, but were still 64% below the same quarter in 2019. Tourist arrivals for the whole of 2021 are expected to remain 70-75% below those of 2019, about the same as 2020.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Nissan</strong> outlined an ambitious plan to invest in electric vehicles. The Japanese company will spend ¥2trn ($17.7bn) on producing new electric or hybrid models, aiming for an “electrification mix” of more than 50% globally by 2030. It will still sell cars with internal-combustion engines.</p><p class="article__body-text">Australia’s securities commission said it would fine <strong>Westpac</strong>, one of the country’s biggest banks, for wrongly charging customers, including dead people. The regulator found that, among other things, Westpac had sought fees from over 11,000 deceased customers “for financial-advice services that were not provided due to their death”.</p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The world this week section of the print edition under the headline "Business"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Business&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fkm2j4n0rra6itbp0b98594233ghic225&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
