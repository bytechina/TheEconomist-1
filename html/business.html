The government had hoped that falling petrol prices, now at a six-month low of $3.70 a gallon, would ease inflationary pressures. But core inflation, which does not include volatile energy and food prices, rose sharply. Household electricity bills were up by 15.8%, year on year, the biggest jump since 1981, and natural gas by 33%. </p><p class="article__body-text">Inflation did fall in <b>Britain</b> for the first time in nearly a year, to 9.9%, mostly because of the decrease in petrol prices. The rate is expected to fall again, given the government’s massive energy-relief package, which will cap household bills. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Stockmarkets</b> were rattled by the inflation data, which point to another big rise in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The <small>s&amp;p 500</small> dropped by 4.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 3.9% (all 30 stocks that make up the Dow fell) and the <small>nasdaq</small> by 5.2%. They were the biggest one-day declines in the indices for two years. </p><p class="article__body-text">Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, gave details of a proposed <b>windfall tax</b> on <a href="./the-european-commission-searches-for-a-gas-price-villain.html">energy companies</a> to help households struggling with rocketing bills. Ms von der Leyen aims to raise €140bn ($140bn) from electricity companies, and said that oil, gas and coal firms would have to make a “crisis contribution”. She also promised that the commission would undertake a comprehensive reform of the electricity market. </p></div></body></html>
