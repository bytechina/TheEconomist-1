Didi’s flotation, the biggest by a Chinese firm in America since Alibaba’s in 2014, angered the Chinese government, which started an investigation of the ride-hailing company’s practices and stopped it from signing up new users. Didi will relist its shares in Hong Kong.</p><h2>A slap for spac s</h2><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Grab’s</strong> share price struggled to recover from the hammering it took on its first day of trading on the Nasdaq exchange. The Singaporean “super-app”, which offers a wide range of services on its platform across South-East Asia, listed by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company (<small>SPAC</small>), a process that avoids the rigours of a regular <small>IPO</small>. Grab’s stockmarket debut had been one of the most eagerly awaited flotations of 2021.</p><p class="article__body-text">The uncertainty surrounding Chinese tech was a factor pulling down <strong>Weibo’s</strong> share price on its first day of trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The internet company’s stock fell by 7% in the secondary listing; it also has shares trading on the Nasdaq market.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> overhauled its senior management team and is to merge its smartphone business with its hitherto separate and wider consumer-electronics division. Combining the two will boost Samsung’s ability to provide customers with joined-up services across devices, similar to Apple.</p><p class="article__body-text">Concern grew about the Russian state’s intentions for social media when a complex set of deals involving subsidiaries linked to Gazprom gave the state-owned gas company voting control of <strong>VKontakte</strong>, Russia’s largest social network. Its chief executive stepped down. Russian media speculated that his replacement might be a senior executive at the state telecoms group, who is also the son of Vladimir Putin’s deputy chief of staff.</p><p class="article__body-text">Faced with an annual inflation rate running close to 11%, <strong>Brazil’s</strong> central bank raised its benchmark interest rate for the seventh time in 2021, by a hefty 1.5 percentage points to 9.25%, and indicated there will be more to come in 2022.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Productivity</strong> among American workers in the third quarter declined by 5.2% from the previous quarter (on an annualised basis), the steepest such fall since 1960. The number of hours worked rose by 7.4%, far outpacing a 1.8% jump in output. The supply-chain crunch may have been a factor.</p><p class="article__body-text">The takeover of <strong>Arm</strong>, a British chip designer, by <strong>Nvidia</strong>, an American company which designs and sells computer chips, came closer to collapse. America’s Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, arguing that it will harm competition. British and <small>EU</small> regulators are also investigating the takeover, though the <small>EU</small> has paused its inquiry. The takeover was announced more than a year ago.</p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="./a-court-bashes-uber-into-compliance-again.html"><strong>Uber’s</strong> business in London</a> took another knock when the High Court ruled that it cannot act as the agent between the passenger and driver, meaning Uber, and not the driver, is liable for any mishaps affecting car journeys. Uber had sought a clarification of the law after the British Supreme Court decided in February that its drivers are workers, not contractors. This week’s ruling will apply to all private-hire car firms in the capital. London is one of Uber’s biggest urban markets.</p><h2>Gridlocked</h2><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/634/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211211_WWC155.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211211_WWC155.png" srcset="../image/20211211_WWC155.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">A report from <small>INRIX</small>, a trans port analytics firm, found that London had become the world’s most <strong>congested city</strong>, with motorists spending an average of 148 hours in traffic jams during 2021. The report (which omits cities such as Cairo and Lagos where Inrix lacks data) said that congestion in London was almost back to pre-pandemic levels, even though trips to central London were still down on those of 2019. In New York the overall number of hours lost to traffic delays was 27% below those of 2019 and in Los Angeles, 40%. In Paris it was 15%.</p><p class="article__body-text">At a gathering of global oil executives in Houston, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco warned that the rapid transition towards economies with <strong>net-zero emissions</strong> is based on “highly unrealistic scenarios and assumptions”, and that some people find it hard to admit that fossil fuels will be around for some time. Amin Nasser said the high cost of switching to net zero could cause social unrest.</p><p class="article__body-text">Always looking to improve efficiency with new technology, management has found a way to extend Zoom’s usefulness beyond wasteful meetings: <strong>mass redundancies</strong>. The <small>CEO</small> of Better.com, a mortgage firm, told the 900 staff who had joined a video call that their employment was “terminated, effective immediately”, because of changing market conditions. The boss later apologised for the way he handled the lay-offs.</p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The world this week section of the print edition under the headline "Business"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Business&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-09&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F3a4ppjeubpi8140epupqgguhfce00bp8&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
