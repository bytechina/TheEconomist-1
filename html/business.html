The day before the attack the <small>S&amp;P</small> 500 had already hit its lowest level in eight months, taking it down by almost 12% since the beginning of the year. Before the assault the <small>NASDAQ</small> was also down from the start of January, by 17%. The Moscow Exchange suspended trading when the invasion began. When trading resumed the Moex index of Russia’s leading companies plunged by 45% before pulling back some of its losses.

It will implement all of the investigation’s recommendations.</p><p class="article__body-text">Fresh concerns about China’s regulatory crackdown on the <a href="./21807805.html"><strong>tech industry</strong></a> caused another sell-off in Chinese tech stocks. Meituan’s share price swooned after regulators said they wanted the food-delivery platform to reduce its fees to restaurants.

The activist investor is a veteran of boardroom battles, including an unsuccessful attempt to block a buy-out of Dell and a clash with Warren Buffett over an oil-company takeover.
