It was thought the central bank would lift the rate by half a point, but a few days before its decision data showed that America’s annual <b>inflation</b> rate, as measured by the consumer-price index, increased to 8.6% in May, higher than had been expected. Grocery prices were up by an average 11.9%, the biggest increase since 1979.
