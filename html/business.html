Higher energy costs were the main factor behind rising prices, but transport and food also added to the squeeze on household bills. Calls to freeze the price cap on domestic energy are growing louder. An average household is expected to see its annual bill double to over £4,300 ($5,200) by January. On account of the cost-of-living crunch, real <b>wages</b> fell by 3% between April and June, the most since records began in 2001. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Britain’s economy</b> was moribund in the second quarter, shrinking by 0.1% over the previous three months. Workers were given an extra day off in June to celebrate the queen’s jubilee, though the number-crunchers said that had little impact on growth. <b>Japan’s</b> <b><small>gdp</small></b> expanded by 0.5% in the quarter, having registered zero growth at the start of year. The country’s economy is now back to its pre-pandemic size. </p><p class="article__body-text">Markets breathed a sigh of relief when <b>Walmart</b> published a solid set of quarterly earnings. In July the retailer issued its second profit warning of the year, but revenue was up sharply in the latest quarter, reflecting the stiffer price of the average shopping basket. Walmart said customer behaviour had changed, with lower-income shoppers buying more canned meat and less deli produce, and that it was seeing more higher-income consumers in its shops. <b>Home Depot</b> reported a similar story, as it chalked up its highest-ever sales in a quarter. </p><p class="article__body-text">Prices of <b>natural gas</b> surged again in Europe, amid more jitters about the reliability of Russian supplies, problems with gas-carrying barges navigating the Rhine and traders trying to shore up gas stocks ahead of the winter. Dutch front-month futures rose to €226 ($230) a megawatt-hour, close to the price in early March and ten times above the seasonal average. Natural-gas prices also rose sharply in America. Underground stockpiles have fallen there as power generators tap the gas to produce more electricity during the hot summer. </p></div></body></html>
