As in other countries, inflation is expected to remain high because of the dual crunch in energy markets and supply chains. Speaking before the release of the data, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the <a data-tegid="l8a9qvcjmo3g4qcgo9adcjc9mi44eur4" href="./the-bank-of-england-should-not-raise-interest-rates-until-2022.html"><strong>Bank of England</strong></a>, said that action might be needed to tame inflationary pressures. Some saw this as a sign that the central bank will raise interest rates before Christmas, though Mr Bailey suggested he is more concerned about taming prices over the medium term.</p><p class="article__body-text"><a href="./21805770.html"><strong>Jens Weidmann</strong></a> announced that he would step down as president of Germany’s Bundesbank, a position he has held since 2011.

Russia provided 43% of the European Union’s gas imports last year. The Kremlin denies it is withholding supplies as a way of pressing Germany to certify Russia’s recently completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In Germany a senior Green politician accused Russia of blackmail and said the pipeline should not get a permit.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Tesla</strong> reported quarterly records for both revenue ($13.8bn) and net profit ($1.6bn).
