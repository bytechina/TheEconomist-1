Will he move faster on economic reform, or concentrate his energies on efforts to change Japan’s war-renouncing constitution? How did he get on with China's President Xi Jinping when the two leaders met in Beijing last month? What are his plans for next year’s 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war. And could Japan’s relations with South Korea be on the mend?</span></p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Abe met Dominic Ziegler, Asia editor of <em>The Economist</em>, and Tamzin Booth, our Tokyo bureau chief, in the former Kantei building in Tokyo. The residence’s history is entwined with that of Japan’s darkest period: in 1932, young military officers entered and shot to death the then prime minister, Tsuyoshi Inukai. Within four years the militarists were in charge. </p><p class="article__body-text">The prompt for the interview was the <a data-tegid="bgedkpocnfed6205e20468gfh5aaisjg" href="./moment-of-reckoning.html">upcoming election</a>, but the conversation ranged widely: through structural reform in the labour market, the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement, the rise of China and Japan's dispute with it over the Senkaku islands (known to the Chinese as the Diaoyu). It closed with an exploration of controversies surrounding Japan’s wartime past. Mr Abe struck a confident and relaxed tone, even on difficult subjects. He emphasised that his economic programme, known as Abenomics, was, and would remain, his priority. <span>A full transcript, using the words of Mr Abe's interpreter and lightly edited for clarity, is available below. </span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span><strong>The Economist:</strong> Recently you seem to have been a whirlwind of activity. You’ve done a lightning tour of the Asia-Pacific region, three major summits in three different cities. You broke the ice with President Xi Jinping in Beijing, and in Brisbane you had a trilateral meeting with the leaders of Australia and the United States. No sooner were you back than you declared the date for a snap election and you dissolved the Diet. It seems, and this has often struck us at </span><em>The Economist</em><span>, that you think of yourself as a man in a hurry, a man with a mission.</span></p></div></body></html>
