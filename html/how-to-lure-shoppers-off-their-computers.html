It was supposed to help lure shoppers freed from lockdown away from internet stores and back to Britain’s best-known shopping thoroughfare. But once the first visitors were allowed on it, it was revealed to be a mess. Rain swept turf off the slopes, leaving bare scaffolding on view. What grass remained turned brown. To Britons familiar with children’s television, it was reminiscent of a shabby, low-rent Teletubbyland.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/how-to-lure-shoppers-off-their-computers.mp3" title="How to lure shoppers off their computers?"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">During construction the cost ballooned from £3.3m ($4.7m) to £6m. After it opened, plans to charge for entry were scrapped. The deputy leader of Westminster Council, which commissioned the mound from <small>MVRDV</small>, a Dutch design company, resigned. Opposition councillors said the mound was “an international embarrassment” and called for it to be dismantled immediately. It is due to come down as planned on January 9th.</p><p class="article__body-text">It has managed to draw in passers-by, perhaps in search of a chuckle. By December 13th 215,000 had visited, not far off Westminster Council’s goal of 280,000 (which was based on plans to charge up to £8 for entry). On a sunny day the view is decent, taking in Hyde Park, the Shard and the London Eye (an unfortunate reminder that other, better views are available). On a recent morning a dozen people milled about on its rickety viewing platform. “We wouldn’t have paid, mind you,” says a couple from Bristol. The structure feels “temporary”, says another sightseer. You enter via a ramp alongside some scrappy planting, and leave through the interior, a maze of scaffolding that creaks with every step.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Before covid-19 Oxford Street was already struggling, over-dependent on department stores that were losing the retail battle to online shopping, and lacking the restaurants, bars and gyms that would attract visitors round the clock. Air pollution and traffic made it a miserable place to stroll. Pedestrianising could have helped, but was opposed by residents of other parts of the West End who feared displaced traffic.</p><p class="article__body-text">During the pandemic Oxford Street also suffered disproportionately. According to Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a property consultancy, and MyTraffic, a data-analytics firm, in the year from March 2020 footfall declined more than in any other major European shopping district. Sales are below the level of 2019, says Marie Hickey of Savills, an estate agent. Between March 2020 and August 2021 a fifth of its stores closed. Five department stores are downsizing or converting retail space into offices.</p><p class="article__body-text">Westminster Council’s proposal for revival, announced in February 2021, was a £150m facelift. It included making temporarily widened pavements permanent, installing public art, upgrading nearby parks—and the mound. Some of this is sensible, in particular the wider pavements: shoppers are more likely to visit bricks-and-mortar outlets if walking between them is more pleasant. Rents have come down since before the pandemic, too, which makes retail more viable. But the only long-term solution for Oxford Street, says Ms Hickey, is becoming less retail-heavy and more mixed-use.</p><p class="article__body-text">Look past the gimmicky mound, and there are early signs that things are heading in the right direction. <small>IKEA</small> will open up shop in 2023. Some department stores are planning gyms, pools and restaurants. Perhaps the pandemic was just what Oxford Street needed. Business had got so bad that it forced much-needed change. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Over the hills"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=How%20to%20lure%20shoppers%20off%20their%20computers%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fgkjt13fk2so2lghb8s7v7f2n2fpjmqrg&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
