The friendly bid would be the biggest private-equity buyout ever in Europe. It needs both the approval of the firm’s board members and of the government, which can veto a takeover of a national champion.</p><p class="article__body-text">Shares in <small>TIM</small> gained 30% after the announcement, but Vivendi, <small>TIM</small>’s largest shareholder, threw a spanner in the works, saying it had no intention to sell its 24% stake. The French media firm says the offer is too low. That is a more than usually moot point. The cash offer gives an enterprise value (including debt) of €33.2bn, and represents a 46% premium on the closing price before <small>KKR</small> bid. But the €0.50 per share <small>KKR</small> could offer is only about half of what Vivendi spent, on average, when it bought its first stake in mid-2015.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/11/articles/body/20211127_wbc297.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211127_wbc297.png" srcset="../image/20211127_wbc297.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text"><small>TIM</small> has been in terrible shape for years. Its shares had fallen by 70% since Vivendi bought in; under its current boss, Luigi Gubitosi (pictured) it has issued two profit warnings since July. <small>KKR</small> could take control of <small>TIM</small> without Vivendi’s shares by buying at least 51% of shares. Yet the two big shareholders would have to agree broadly what is needed to overhaul <small>TIM</small> as <small>KKR</small> needs a two-thirds majority of shareholder votes if it is to perform radical surgery.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>TIM</small>’s problems date back to 1999 when a leveraged buyout by Roberto Colaninno, boss of Olivetti, a smaller telecoms firm, saddled the company with huge debts. After that it was unable to invest enough in its infrastructure to eventually fend off foreign entrants Wind, Iliad and Vodafone. At home Telecom Italia is notorious for political interference, bad governance and squabbling shareholders. As if that were not enough, its workforce is bloated, with around 50,000 employees in Italy.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>KKR</small> wants to spin off the firm’s infrastructure business from its services business. The hope is that a separation would give more focus to each unit and allow each to claim the right amount of investment. Analysts expect <small>KKR</small> to move the infrastructure unit into a separate holding firm where it will be the majority investor. Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, Italy’s state development bank, which owns 10% of <small>TIM,</small> is expected to remain a minority investor, letting the Italian state keep a hand in a strategic sector.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Draghi is widely believed to favour the deal. Yet he would not welcome a fight between <small>KKR</small> and Vivendi, which is controlled by Vincent Bolloré, a French corporate raider. Such a scrap could boost populist rivals. Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right Northern League party which is part of the coalition government, is calling for <small>TIM</small>’s management to be changed, to block a takeover.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline "Tim’s troubles"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=KKR%20bids%20for%20Telecom%20Italia%20in%20a%20mammoth%20private-equity%20deal&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-27&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fod2410t2ocot8g1ni5u4pdb9oi22hnns&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
