That Mr Adani is reported to be the richest man in Asia is one concern, but it is not the main one. Rather, it is his close ties to the country’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, that cause disquiet.</p><p class="article__body-text">What happens to broadcast journalism is no quaint distraction, even in an age of smartphones and social media. Television remains ubiquitous, whether watched at home, on supersized screens in malls and offices or on tiny screens on people’s phones. It is also highly concentrated, with most channels owned by Reliance Industries, a conglomerate controlled by Mukesh Ambani, another towering business figure. Mr Ambani, as it happens, is also a pal of Mr Modi. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Does this matter? At the moment it looks more likely than not that Mr Adani will succeed in taking over <small>ndtv</small> (whose boss is a distant relative of a senior editor at <i>The Economist</i>). Protestations could follow, suggesting that the newsroom will go untouched, whoever the owner might be. The reality will be different. Broadcast journalists who, until now, have been willing to criticise the government, or merely to report fairly and independently, will increasingly <a href="./rana-ayyub-says-we-should-stop-calling-journalists-brave.html">feel constrained to toe official lines</a>. Ahead of a general election in 2024, the space for opposition politicians to air their views without being shouted at, as is routine on other channels, would surely shrink.</p><p class="article__body-text">The saga carries the whiff of an earlier age. Traditionally, Indian governments influenced the media by exploiting the industry’s ownership structure. Like Messrs Adani and Ambani, whose business interests range from airports and refineries to retail and textile, the owners of most media companies also make serious money in other sectors. That provides politicians with pressure points. To rein in critical coverage, but without the bad optics of leaning directly on editors, those in office turn on those sister industries instead. The withdrawal of an operating licence here, or the threatened loss of a lucrative government contract there, would usually be enough to persuade owners to whip their irritating journalists into line.</p><p class="article__body-text">Under Mr Modi’s government, and his Bharatiya Janata Party (<small>bjp</small>), the use of such <a href="./indias-government-is-ignoring-and-sometimes-even-encouraging-hatred-of-minorities.html">old tactics has grown</a>. Independent journalists say the commercial arms of their media organisations put steadily more pressure on newsrooms. Sometimes a quiet word comes down from the owners themselves. Those who criticise the mighty have always run the risk of politicians refusing to speak to them for a while. This has grown worse, journalists report; some are now denied any access at all to elected officials. This bodes ill for accountability. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The government has also become more creative. Laws on defamation are not new. But journalists say they increasingly find themselves at the receiving end of direct legal threats. One weapon of choice is spurious defamation cases, says Siddharth Varadarajan, co-founder of The Wire, an independent news website set up in 2015. (Plenty of online outlets still try to hold the powerful to account, even as newspapers grow ever more bland and television presenters barely bother disguising their propaganda.) Lawsuits disrupt reporters’ work and tie them down in lengthy, often years-long legal proceedings. Fortunately, constitutional safeguards prevent many of them being thrown into prison.</p><p class="article__body-text">A second approach, to intimidate critics more effectively, is for the authorities to use criminal laws that were first dreamt up to fight sedition or terrorism. These allow for long spells of pre-trial detention. Mr Varadarajan reckons the government began to use such laws more intensively to stifle criticism during the pandemic, when it assumed wide-ranging powers for public-health reasons. The government was emboldened “to give in to existing authoritarian impulses”, he says.</p><p class="article__body-text">Freelancers and reporters for smaller outlets feel the burden of this heavily, as they lack the legal resources of bigger organisations. Most at risk, apparently, are Muslim reporters in states ruled by the Hindu-nationalist <small>bjp</small>. Siddique Kappan, a journalist from Kerala, has spent the best part of two years in jail in Uttar Pradesh after he was arrested in October 2020 while on his way to report on the alleged rape and murder of a young Dalit woman. He was charged, among other things, with sedition. His driver, who was also arrested, was released on bail after more than 22 months. Mohammed Zubair, the co-founder of a fact-checking service, recently spent more than three weeks in pre-trial detention after an anonymous complaint that a four-year-old tweet of his had hurt the religious feelings of Hindus. Fahad Shah, Sajad Gul and Aasif Sultan, three Kashmiri journalists, have been locked up in Jammu, charged with terrorism offences under the Public Safety Act.</p><p class="article__body-text">State governments are as ready as the central one to intimidate members of the press. Authorities in <small>bjp</small>-run Gujarat last week charged two journalists with spreading hatred for publishing a piece speculating on the potentially imminent sacking of the chief minister (another journalist was arrested and charged with sedition in May 2020 for a similar story about the current chief minister’s predecessor). Opposition-run states are little better. Two journalists were arrested in West Bengal, in 2020, after reporting on allegations of corruption against the Trinamool Congress, which runs the state. In May India’s press club complained to the Aam Aadmi Party, which governs Delhi, after a journalist said he was roughed up by police outside a press conference with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Reporters without Borders, an advocacy group, this year ranked India in 150th place (out of 180 countries) in its annual index of press freedom. That is India’s lowest position ever–down from 80th (out of 139) two decades ago.</p><p class="article__body-text">Don’t expect that to be reversed. Some journalists try to find solace in the fact that a more hostile environment may force them to do better work, amassing more evidence and better sources before daring to publish a story. Plenty of courageous reporters still defy threats of harassment, intimidation or jail. But, assuming Mr Adani succeeds in taking over <small>ndtv</small>, the fear is that space for free speech—or simple truth-telling—on India’s most influential news medium will shrink further. If so, it will grow harder for India’s defenders to brag that theirs remains a lively, outspoken and confident place. When Indian journalists are muzzled, India is diminished.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:</b><br/><i><a href="./south-koreas-president-needs-to-learn-the-basics.html">South Korea’s president needs to learn the basics</a> (Aug 25th)</i><br/><i><a href="./the-rising-prominence-of-the-indian-ocean-worries-the-countries-in-it.html">The rising prominence of the Indian Ocean worries the countries in it</a> (Aug 18th)</i><br/><i><a href="./how-not-to-administer-justice-after-a-brutal-civil-war.html">How not to administer justice after a brutal civil war</a> (Aug 13th)</i></p></div></body></html>
