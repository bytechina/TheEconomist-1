For the first few decades of its existence <small>NCMEC</small>’s focus was on abductions in America, helping investigations run across state lines. But as the use of the internet grew it started to turn its attention to the harm caused through online activity, specifically the trade of imagery depicting the sexual abuse of children.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/a-38-year-old-charity-will-be-integrated-into-apples-newest-operating-system.mp3" title="A 38-year-old charity will be integrated into Apple’s newest operating system"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>NCMEC</small>’s role as an information clearing house has become far more technical as a result. In 1998 it started building a database of imagery known to depict sexual abuse of children based on the tips it had received. The technical term for this kind of data is <small>CSAM</small> (Child Sexual Abuse Material), mostly images or videos. Only <small>NCMEC</small> is shielded from liability to the extent that it can store <small>CSAM</small> and share it with law enforcement, but in 2006 the organisation began to think of ways that it might use the database to catch other <small>CSAM</small> trafficking. It came up with the idea of generating a long, unique string of letters and numbers known as a hash for each image in its database, then sharing those hashes with companies that wanted to scan their services for <small>CSAM</small>. By reversing the hashing process, companies could scan images on their services just for known <small>CSAM</small>, and report anything they found back to <small>NCMEC</small>.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This has led to an expansion of the number of tips that are sent to <small>NCMEC</small>, as technology companies scan automatically and voluntarily for <small>CSAM</small>. In 2010 <small>NCMEC</small> received 220,000 tips. By 2020 that number had grown to 21.7 million. And it is set to get bigger. On August 5th Apple announced that the next generation of its phone and laptop software would come with <small>NCMEC</small>’s hash database pre-installed, and would scan its users’ devices for <small>CSAM</small> automatically. Apple’s plans have stimulated fierce debate about whether the new system will provide an avenue for governments to expand their capacity to scan private devices for other illicit content. Many technology companies already used <small>NCMEC</small>’s hashes to scan their own cloud servers for <small>CSAM</small>, but Apple is taking this further with an encrypted system that runs scans on users’ own phones and laptops.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet the government could not easily force <small>NCMEC</small> or Apple to tweak this phone-scanning capability to look for other things. That is because any evidence thrown up by those compelled searches would be inadmissible in court for violating the Fourth Amendment. Crucially, none of the technology companies scanning for <small>CSAM</small>, nor <small>NCMEC</small>’s storage of it, does so, because the scans are done on a voluntary basis. The Fourth Amendment only protects against unreasonable searches by the government—ones that are carried out without a warrant. Arrests can be made only because of the voluntary nature of the <small>CSAM</small> scanning.</p><p class="article__body-text">Most of the attention has focused on the technical details of Apple’s new <small>CSAM</small> scanning system. It will be released along with i<small>OS</small>15, the next update to its iPhone operating system, in September. Those technical details are important. Experts are poring over every available detail of the new software to determine whether it has introduced a security weakness to iPhones. But Apple’s ability to make this change also rests on the social norms that have underpinned the fight against child abuse in America for decades. The willing co-operation of third parties has long been all that makes it possible for law enforcement to track down child abusers in private spaces. Apple is now testing whether this willingness extends into the phones in Americans’ pockets. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Hashing ambiguous"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%2038-year-old%20charity%20will%20be%20integrated%20into%20Apple%E2%80%99s%20newest%20operating%20system&amp;publicationDate=2021-08-12&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frvnjbs113hgan23sfcqk0gp5ph6hd05r&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
