The first—24-year-old Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin—was from Iraqi Kurdistan and was crossing to reunite with her fiancé, after failing to get permission to come to Britain, her family told the BBC. Many others were also Kurds from Iraq. At least one other travelled from Iran. One of the two survivors was from Somalia.</p><p class="article__body-text">People who cross the Channel illegally from France to Britain have normally fled extreme risks at home such as war and famine. Most, anecdotal evidence suggests, are trying to join other family members, as Ms Amin and at least one other of her boatmates hoped to do. Almost all go on to seek asylum, and many qualify. Would-be asylum-seekers take to boats in part because legal routes are largely closed. Britain currently has no humanitarian-visa scheme for asylum-seekers. A plan announced in August to resettle Afghans who worked for Western countries and agencies has yet to get off the ground. So can Britain put a stop to illicit Channel crossings, when so many people are so desperate to reunite with family in a safe country? It has reduced the number of crossings before, but under different circumstances. This time curbing the boats will require close co-operation with France. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In the late 1990s migrants started taking lorries in large numbers from the port of Calais in north-west France to Britain. That journey was also dangerous. In 2000, 58 migrants suffocated in the back of a lorry while in transit. Three years later, under British pressure, the French tightened border security around the port. The British also introduced their own border controls at the port, to process people before they could reach British soil. The result is that far fewer people now enter on lorries. But that diverted people to boats, a journey that is also dangerous. In 2018, just 2% of the migrants that British authorities caught trying to enter the country through informal routes were attempting a sea crossing. In 2020, 50% were. </p><p class="article__body-text">Boat arrivals are likely to decrease over the winter, as the Channel’s waters get choppier and colder. But they will pick up again in the spring unless something changes. Stopping them will be much harder than preventing migrants from stowing away in lorries. Already, those seeking to evade border patrols launch dinghies from a stretch of coastline in north-west France 130 miles (210km) long. Monitoring that area would take many more border patrols and cost tens of millions of pounds. </p><p class="article__body-text">It could be done. This summer, Britain committed to providing France with £54m ($73m) to stop boat arrivals. France claims it has rescued and brought back 7,800 people this year. Britain could send more money, on the condition that France does more to patrol the beaches. But instead of co-operating further, the two countries are blaming each other. France claims Britain needs to tighten its labour-market regulations to become a less attractive place for migrants to work. (Even if this were to happen, it would take time for the few migrants making the trip solely for work would get wind of the changes.) Britain, for its part, says France’s border force is turning a blind eye to migrants setting off from its beaches. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Since the most recent drownings, relations between the two countries have further soured. France held an emergency meeting with neighbouring countries to address human smuggling, but disinvited Britain, after Boris Johnson, its prime minister, posted on social media a letter asking the French to take back returned migrants. “We cannot talk government-to-government through Twitter,” said France’s interior minister.</p><p class="article__body-text">Instead of trying to repair bridges, Priti Patel, Britain’s home secretary, has doubled down on a strategy that is unlikely to work. Ms Patel says a <a href="./priti-patels-asylum-changes-will-make-life-harder-for-refugees.html">new nationality-and-borders bill</a> will deter migrants. The legislation, which is making its way through Parliament, would penalise people who qualify for asylum but arrive through informal routes like boats—even though research has found that harsh asylum policies have little deterrent effect. If Ms Patel truly wants to stop the boats, she should extend a hand to France. The most recent drownings have shown the human cost of a political crisis.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-might-new-variants-like-omicron-spread-more-easily.html">Why might new covid-19 variants like Omicron spread more easily?</a><br/><a href="./what-is-the-jcpoa-the-deal-meant-to-restrict-irans-nuclear-activity.html">What is the JCPOA, the deal meant to restrict Iran’s nuclear activity?</a><br/><a href="./what-are-britains-freeports.html">What are Britain’s freeports?</a></p></div></body></html>
