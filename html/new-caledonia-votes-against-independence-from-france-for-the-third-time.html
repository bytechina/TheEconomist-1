It was the last of three referendums laid out in the Nouméa Accord of 1998, a compact designed to end bitter conflict between the islands’ loyalist politicians and the largely indigenous and pro-independence Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (<small>FLNKS</small>). The result is a turnaround from the previous two polls, when it seemed as though pro-independence sentiment was gaining strength. In the first, in 2018, 43.3% voted “oui” to independence; in the second, two years later, 46.7% did.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/new-caledonia-votes-against-independence-from-france-for-the-third-time.mp3" title="New Caledonia votes against independence from France for the third time"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The reason was not a sudden surge in affection for <em>l’Hexagone</em> but a collapse in turnout—the 44% of eligible voters who showed up amounting to barely more than half the 86% at the previous ballot in October 2020. The <small>FLNKS</small> had argued for a delay to the poll after a recent Delta wave that killed one in 1,000 residents, mostly Pacific Islanders. A perception that delaying the vote would boost the odds of independence no doubt played a role in the <small>FLNKS</small>’s call for postponement, too. The government in Paris insisted on sticking to the appointed date, to avoid criticism from nationalists in the run-up to the French presidential election in April. Pro-independence campaigners boycotted the vote.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The French government dismissed the turnout as legally irrelevant. In the past, it had presented itself as a neutral arbiter in the dispute between the territory’s loyalist and pro-independence politicians. This time was different. A 100-page government document released before the poll warned of dire economic consequences if New Caledonia seceded. Abandoning the reticence of his predecessors, the French Minister for Overseas Territories, Sébastien Lecornu, unexpectedly pitched up in New Caledonia the day before the referendum, sending a clear message of French reluctance to cede control.</p><p class="article__body-text">Geopolitics played a role in the anti-independence campaign, too. New Caledonia has around a tenth of the world’s nickel reserves. The metal accounts for 90% of exports, mostly to Asia. Loyalist parties argued that an independent New Caledonia would become a Chinese vassal state.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Macron hopes that the result will render the Nouméa Accord void, ending what he calls the “binary choice” between independence and staying part of France. “We must now build a common project, while recognising and respecting the dignity of everyone,” he said. Yet key elements of the devolved structure agreed on in the accord, including a power-sharing agreement between the loyalist and pro-independence parties, will remain in place.</p><p class="article__body-text">Pro-independence parties, for their part, refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of the latest ballot. They have shunned Mr Lecornu’s post-referendum overtures for negotiations for a new political settlement, though these, too, are required under the Nouméa Accord. In the background lurks the impending contest for the French presidency. Until then, Mr Macron is likely to be in no mood for concessions. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "Rule of three"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=New%20Caledonia%20votes%20against%20independence%20from%20France%20for%20the%20third%20time&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F4cet852ojhg95uf1crbtk7fuq090s705&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
