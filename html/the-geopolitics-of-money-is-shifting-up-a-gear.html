Over the past year one of its main networks, <small>SWIFT</small>, carried $140trn of transactions, a record level and the equivalent of about 150% of global <small>GDP</small>. It is an impressive sum but more must be done to modernise the payments architecture if its pre-eminence is to last.</p><p class="article__body-text">The way money flows around the world is still overwhelmingly under the control of liberal democracies. Payments typically happen in the dollar and to a lesser extent the euro, pound and yen. This is, on balance, good for the world, providing a reliable system governed by law. It is certainly good for Western countries, bolstering their legal norms, firms and influence.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/468/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/10/articles/body_2" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/body_2" srcset="../image/body_2"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Behind it lie myriad institutions, from banks to New York’s clearing-houses. Despite its importance, <small>SWIFT</small>, owned by global banks and founded in the 1970s, is an obscure part of all this. It connects 11,000 banks in over 200 countries, providing a messaging system for transactions. Although it is based in Europe, it is an accidental linchpin of American influence, with JPMorgan Chase alone accounting for 24% of <small>SWIFT</small> dollar volumes.</p><p class="article__body-text">The threat to <small>SWIFT</small> comes from <a href="./21805736.html">several sides</a>. Its own record is patchy. In 2016 North Korean hackers used stolen <small>SWIFT</small> credentials to steal $81m from the Bangladeshi central bank. America is complacent about the dollar system. It has used <small>SWIFT</small> to pursue politicised sanctions, giving countries an incentive to develop alternatives. In addition, America has been slow to upgrade payments systems at home or to develop a central-bank digital currency, and Congress is critical of the Federal Reserve’s stabilising global role.</p><p class="article__body-text">Meanwhile big tech firms, credit-card networks and banks are keen to create alternatives. On October 19th Facebook launched its digital wallet. Innovation is welcome, but if only a few firms dominate, fees will rise and poorer countries suffer. And China is trying its own payments system, called <small>CIPS</small>, and a central-bank digital currency. It has just asked McDonald’s to adopt the e-yuan in its Chinese branches.</p><p class="article__body-text">Rather than assume that the dominance of payments is their birthright, democracies should ensure their systems are faster, cheaper and safer so that they remain firms’ first choice on merit. <small>SWIFT</small> has upgraded its network and says that 92% of large transfers on its high-speed pipes happen within a day. Not all kinds of financial-market transactions <a href="./why-it-matters-when-trades-settle.html">need to be settled at once</a> but <small>SWIFT</small> should aim for its payments to be instantaneous. Another goal should be to connect to more real-time domestic payments networks, which are live in 65 countries. This may cost money, but <small>SWIFT</small>’s capital expenditure in 2020 was $56m, less than a fifth of the budget of payments giants such as Ant Group and Visa.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The hardest task will be to reform <small>SWIFT</small>’s governance. Its board is packed with European banks, which was justifiable in the 1970s when they dominated cross-border finance, but now looks anachronistic. The board’s 25 seats include just two American firms and a single Chinese one. India and Brazil have none. America and Asia should be better represented, even as liberal democratic countries remain in control. When a house needs renovating a good place to start is the plumbing. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em><em>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, <a data-analytics="in_body:link_1:para_10" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.economist.com/moneytalks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628284234418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGviR-zkpwefPKZAIJbeHx5M_SGCQ" href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Money Talks</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "Be swift, be bold"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20geopolitics%20of%20money%20is%20shifting%20up%20a%20gear&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-23&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F5pbd50hqtaoe2s1csga4q47uc6cdf6tr&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
