On November 24th a jury agreed, convicting three white men, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis, and William Bryan, a neighbour, of murder.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21806458.mp3" title="The killers of Ahmaud Arbery are found guilty"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">In their pickup trucks, armed with a pistol and a shotgun, the three had followed Mr Arbery as he jogged through their neighbourhood, Satilla Shores,in south-eastern Georgia. They confronted him, a scuffle ensued, and Travis McMichael shot Mr Arbery three times with his shotgun.</p><p class="article__body-text">The defence had claimed that the McMichaels acted in self-defence. (Mr Bryan’s lawyers argued he had just tagged along and was “irrelevant” to the killing.) “Ahmaud Arbery was not an innocent victim,” argued Laura Hogue, one of Gregory McMichael’s lawyers. In the defendants’ account, they were trying to conduct a legal “citizen’s arrest” because they suspected Mr Arbery of burgling homes.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Several times the young man had been spotted on security cameras in the unfinished nearby home of Larry English. (Mr English’s lawyer had suggested Mr Arbery was getting water from a tap.) Mr Arbery tried to run away when asked to stop, the defence said, so the three men boxed him in with their pickups. According to the defence, Mr Arbery then tried to punch Mr McMichael and steal his gun, forcing him to shoot. “He chose to fight,” Ms Hogue said of Mr Arbery. The shooting was caught on camera by Mr Bryan.</p><p class="article__body-text">Under the law in Georgia at the time, the circumstances in which people could make citizen’s arrests were loosely defined. There had to be “reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion” that the person had committed a felony and was fleeing. After the murder, Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, described this as a “civil-war era” law, and new bipartisan legislation more tightly specified the grounds for a citizen’s arrest.</p><p class="article__body-text">In contending with the previous law, the prosecutors successfully argued that the three men did not have reasonable grounds to suspect Mr Arbery. He had trespassed on Mr English’s property, but trespass is not a felony.In trying to arrest him, Messrs McMichaels and Bryan were in fact committing felonies—false imprisonment and assault—so forfeited any claim of self-defence. “They shot and killed him, not because he was a threat to them, but because he wouldn’t stop and talk to them,” argued Linda Dunikoski, the lead prosecutor.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Dunikoski thus sidestepped the problem that faced the prosecutors in the trial of <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/11/20/the-acquittal-of-kyle-rittenhouse-shows-americas-divide-over-guns">Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, an Illinois teenager acquitted on November 19th of murder in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Mr Rittenhouse had taken up a gun in what he said was an effort to protect property, in his case against rioters during protests against a police shooting. He, too, claimed self-defence.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But there was little evidence Mr Rittenhouse started the fight he ended up finishing with his rifle. The jurors had to judge whether he reasonably believed himself to be in serious danger at the moment he pulled the trigger. The jurors in Glynn County, Georgia, merely had to agree that the attempted “arrest” was unlawful.</p><p class="article__body-text">The prosecutors declined to pursue whether racism motivated the killers, perhaps because 11 of 12 jurors were white. Yet the question of race permeated the trial. It took 74 days, and the release of the shocking video, for the killers even to be charged. In the end, it was not the local police but the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, a statewide agency, that arrested the three suspects. That hardly suggests an environment conducive to justice for black men.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another trial of the defendants, in a federal court, on hate crimes and attempted kidnapping, is due in February. But these convictions will come as a relief to many. An acquittal would in effect have endorsed vigilante justice, even when it leads to the death of an innocent man. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■<br/></span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>Correction (November <em>25th </em>2021): An earlier version of this article referred to protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin <em>against a police killing</em>.
