Protesters from Malaita, the most populous island, crossed to the biggest, Guadalcanal, with grievances over corruption and inequality. They called for the prime minister to go. Near parliament in Honiara, the capital, the protest descended into violence. Three days of looting in the city left much of Chinatown destroyed. Three people died in burning buildings. The damage runs to millions of dollars. It will be a long haul back to normality.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/chinese-influence-is-spurring-violence-in-the-solomon-islands.mp3" title="Chinese influence is spurring violence in the Solomon Islands"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The Solomon Islands is a threadbare state, and Malaitans have always been among the poorest islanders. Investment and jobs are concentrated on Gaudalcanal. Over the decades Malaitans flocked there, which stoked ethnic tensions. In the late 1990s natives of Guadalcanal campaigned, through intimidation, to drive Malaitans off the island. Rival militias fought. In 2003 the government asked Australia for help. The Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (<small>RAMSI</small>) was popular. Its police and troops could not stop rioting in 2006. But it did prevent the Solomon Islands tipping from threadbare state to failed one. <small>RAMSI</small> wound up in 2017, when the Solomon Islands signed a security treaty with Australia.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">On November 25th the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, invoked the treaty. Within hours Australian police and troops were on a plane back to Honiara. And so the old spool unreels. But this time the plot has a new, geopolitical twist. On coming to power in 2019 for the fourth time, Mr Sogavare severed long-standing diplomatic relations with Taiwan and took them up with China, which had been spraying promises of money and development about the region.</p><p class="article__body-text">Daniel Suidani, Malaita’s premier, fiercely opposed the switch. Like many of Malaita’s Christians, he condemns China’s rulers’ communism and atheism. He warns that Chinese companies would bring few benefits. He wants a referendum on secession. His advisers say China is behind attempts to oust him with no-confidence votes.</p><p class="article__body-text">As for China, its nationalistic press and academics accuse America and Australia of fomenting unrest as a means of emboldening Taiwan and thus splitting the motherland. Mr Sogavare also blames “foreign powers” for the turmoil, even as he asks for Australian help.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Sogavare’s finger-pointing is an effort to shift attention away from his own government’s corruption and its failure to help the poorest. China’s finger-pointing is cynical, solipsistic or ill-informed. An inglorious tradition of attacks on Honiara’s Chinese-run businesses, including during riots in 2006, long predates China’s official presence. Many shopkeepers—economic migrants from Fujian province—lord it over locals. They sit on stacks of plastic chairs, monitoring staff and watching for shoplifters. Locals resent their economic dominance, and these Chinese lack the social networks that help protect other ethnic groups in the Solomon Islands from violence. Instead they fortify their shops and warehouses with steel shutters and high windows. Nearby squatter camps full of underemployed young men are a powder keg. In late November squatters breached the forts and looted rice and cooking oil.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Although the roots of the violence are local, no foreign power involved in the geopolitical struggle that is playing out across the region is blameless. China has followed Taiwan in filling slush funds for friendly <small>MP</small>s. The government’s cosy ties with Chinese state enterprises are resented in a country that has long been exploited by foreign timber companies and mining firms.</p><p class="article__body-text">Taiwan tried to create a public-relations splash by giving protective gear to Malaita, but not the rest of the country, during the pandemic. As for America, it became interested in the Solomon Islands only under Donald Trump. A year ago his administration earmarked $25m for Malaita. This unusual move of allocating money to a subnational government accounted for over a tenth of all its new funding in the Pacific. As Mihai Sora of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney, writes, currying sympathy with local actors without considering deeper social and political currents undermines social cohesion.</p><p class="article__body-text">Australia, still the region’s go-to power, now has to deal with the consequences. How much time Mr Sogavare will have to pick up the pieces is unclear. Four of the eight Malaitan <small>MP</small>s in his government have quit. On December 6th he will face a no-confidence vote.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Read more from Banyan, our columnist on Asia:<br/></strong><em><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/11/27/malaysias-sleaziest-ex-prime-minister-najib-razak-is-back">Malaysia’s sleaziest ex-prime minister, Najib Razak, is back</a> (Nov 27th 2021)</em><br/><em><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/11/20/russia-moves-with-a-new-swagger-in-south-east-asia">Russia moves with a new swagger in South-East Asia</a> (Nov 20th 2021)<br/><a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/11/11/how-the-game-of-go-explains-chinas-aggression-towards-india">How the game of Go explains China’s aggression towards India</a> (Nov 13th 2021)<strong><br/></strong></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "A familiar script"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Chinese%20influence%20is%20spurring%20violence%20in%20the%20Solomon%20Islands&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F7an195cou9b057sgklqhpb9aim009led&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
