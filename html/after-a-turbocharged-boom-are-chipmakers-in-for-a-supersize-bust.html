Samsung has warned of stalling profits and is said to be considering dropping prices for memory chips in the second half of 2022. In June Micron Technology, an American memory-chip maker, forecast sales of $7.2bn in the third quarter, a fifth lower than expected.

Added to that, geopolitical tensions risk <a href="./the-semiconductor-industry-and-the-power-of-globalisation.html">splitting up a global market</a> and <a href="./the-structure-of-the-worlds-supply-chains-is-changing.html">shattering complex supply chains</a>. The pandemic’s superstar industry suddenly appears a lot less stellar.</p><p class="article__body-text">Start with supply. One way that firms have been adding capacity is by installing new kit in existing fabs (as <a href="./a-look-inside-the-factory-around-which-the-modern-world-turns.html">chip factories</a> are known). In the second half of 2021 global spending on equipment to etch chips onto silicon wafers jumped by about 75% compared with pre-covid levels, estimates Malcolm Penn of Future Horizons, another research firm. It takes a year or so for such investments to translate into new output, so late 2022 could see a production glut.</p><p class="article__body-text">Firms can also build all-new fabs, which takes a bit longer. According to <small>semi</small>, one more research group, 34 of these came online worldwide in 2020 and 2021. Another 58 are scheduled to open between 2022 and 2024. That would raise global capacity by roughly 40%. Intel has six fabs in the works, including a $20bn leading-edge “megafab” in Ohio, and factories in Arizona and Magdeburg, Germany. Samsung’s plans include a large modern fab in Texas. <small>tsmc</small> is building a similar one in Arizona. Most of these are expected to begin producing chips by 2025.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/media-assets/image/20220716_WBC140.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="336px" src="../image/20220716_WBC140.png" srcset="../image/20220716_WBC140.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">There was always the risk that demand might have faded by then. But the hunger for chips has waned faster than expected. The clearest signs are in the market for personal computers (<small>pc</small>s), which account for about 30% of overall demand for chips of all varieties. After a pandemic boost as working and schooling from home became the norm, global <small>pc</small> shipments will fall by 8% this year, reckons <small>idc</small>. That is partly because some of those pandemic purchases had simply been pulled forward. Sales of smartphones, another 20% of demand, are expected to ebb, too. In April smartphone shipments in China, the world’s biggest market, were a third lower than in the same month last year. The slowdown in <small>pc</small> and phone sales will be sharper still if the world economy dips into <a href="./a-recession-in-america-by-2024-looks-likely.html">recession</a>.</p><p class="article__body-text">Data centres and carmaking consume around one-tenth of the world’s chips apiece. Demand is not forecast to fall this year. But signs of softness can be seen. Chinese orders for server chips, which power data centres, have dropped off. Many <a href="./21803287.html">panicked carmakers</a>, for their part, have double- or triple-ordered chips to avoid the sort of shortages that forced them to cut output last year. Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein, a broker, points out that in the past few quarters shipments of automotive chips have been about 40% higher than what you would expect based on the number of cars shipped and the number of chips in a typical car. Big stockpiles in the car industry may mean a sudden drought of new orders.</p><p class="article__body-text">The downward pressure on prices may be compounded by another powerful force. Political considerations, both domestic and international, increasingly influence chip supply and demand. On the supply side, last year’s crunch spooked governments and reminded those in the West that 75% of all semiconductors come from Asia. Many now want to bring the manufacture, especially of leading-edge chips deemed of strategic importance, within their borders. In America, Congress is wrangling over the <small>chips</small> Act, which, if enacted, would hand the industry up to $52bn over five years in subsidies and research-and-development (<small>r</small>&amp;<small>d</small>) grants. <a href="./21807603.html">The <small>eu</small>’s version</a> offers €43bn ($43bn) until 2030. India, Japan and South Korea have similar schemes. So does <a href="./will-china-dominate-the-world-of-semiconductors.html">China</a>, which launched a semiconductor policy in 2014. </p><p class="article__body-text">State largesse could lead to more overcapacity. And interventionism may further dent the outlook. A chip industry fragmented along national borders would risk wasteful duplication, driving up costs for consumers. A report by <small>bcg</small>, a consultancy, and the Semiconductor Industry Association, a lobby group, finds that in a scenario where semiconductor production is self-sufficient within regions chip prices would increase by between 35% and 65%. </p></div><p class="article__body-text">America’s government seems intent on constricting demand in another way. It is using export controls to deny Chinese buyers access to semiconductors and the tools needed to make them. The urge is understandable: China is an authoritarian challenger to the American-led, rules-based global order. Awkwardly for chipmakers, China is also the world’s biggest chip market. <small>tsmc</small> and Intel have already lost Chinese customers as a result of American restrictions. Others, such as Qualcomm, note in their annual reports that Chinese clients are developing their own chips or switching to local suppliers, in part because of geopolitical tensions. American chipmakers warn that their large <small>r</small>&amp;<small>d</small> budgets would be difficult to sustain if they lost Chinese custom. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Political considerations are a headache for others in the semiconductor value chain, too. On July 5th Bloomberg reported that <small>asml</small>, the <a href="./how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly.html">Dutch monopolist</a> in the market for the $100m lithography machines used to etch high-end chips, was under pressure from America’s government to stop selling its gear to Chinese firms. China accounts for 15% of <small>asml</small>’s sales; its share price fell by 7% on the news. The market values of <small>asml</small>’s American suppliers, such as Azenta and <small>mks</small> Instruments, also slid. Other American toolmakers, such as Applied Materials, <small>kla</small> and Lam Research, derive a third of their revenue from Chinese customers. All are in talks with American authorities to limit their sale of high-tech tools to China.</p><p class="article__body-text">The chip bust may be softened if the drive for silicon self-reliance sputters. Continuous subsidies would be needed to keep American fabs at the cutting edge. That, in turn, would require sustained interest from easily distracted policymakers. This month Intel said it would push back the opening of its fabs in Ohio, blaming delays in passing the <small>chips</small> Act. <small>tsmc</small> has said it may need to slow the construction of its Arizona fab for the same reason. In April Morris Chang, former chairman of <small>tsmc</small>, bluntly called America’s attempt to reshore chip production an “exercise in futility”, pointing to high costs and the lack of engineering expertise. </p><p class="article__body-text">Indeed, take out the state intervention and dips in chip cycles have been getting shallower of late, notes Ajit Manocha, who heads <small>semi</small>. That may be in part because the industry has become more consolidated. In the 1980s 20-odd firms jostled in the market for memory chips. Today it is dominated by three: Micron, Samsung and <small>sk</small> Hynix. At the cutting edge of microprocessor-making, Intel, Samsung and <small>tsmc</small> are the only firms capable of churning out the most advanced kit, down from nearly 30 firms in 2001. Fewer firms control a greater share of capital expenditure and can rein it back in if supply outstrips demand. This will require the chipmakers to rediscover capital discipline—something they have not had to exercise in a while. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to <a href="./page-not-found.html">Money Talks</a>, our weekly newsletter.</i></p></div></body></html>
