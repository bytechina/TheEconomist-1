People who are not inoculated against covid-19 may not, at present, enter the country. But Mr Djokovic, who said in 2020 that he was “opposed to vaccination”, wants to defend his title at the Australian Open, which starts on January 17th. Whether he will get to do so remains uncertain. Australia’s prime minister had said on January 5th that Mr Djokovic would have to “provide acceptable proof that he cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons”. After a wait of several hours on landing at Melbourne airport, Mr Djokovic was told his visa had been cancelled, reportedly after concerns over errors in his application and whether he had the evidence needed for an exemption. </p><style data-emotion="css bvf2nr">.css-bvf2nr{padding-bottom:1.5rem;margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;padding:0;}</style><div class="layout-article-promo

exceptionalism comes at a time when people doing all sorts of jobs are being asked to get vaccinated or to provide proof of their vaccination status. Data gathered by <i>The Economist </i>finds that with few exceptions, men competing in top-tier professional sports are likelier than their country’s general population to be vaccinated. North America’s National Hockey League has the highest vaccination rate among the 11 leagues and associations for which we gathered data. It has reported that 99% of its 700 or so players are fully vaccinated, compared with 73% of American adults overall.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The 11 sporting competitions can be divided into three distinct groups. The two team sports that take place indoors—basketball and ice hockey—have an average vaccination rate of 98%. Since the disease spreads more easily indoors, that is good for both players and fans. Team sports that take place outdoors—football and American football—have a vaccination rate of 94%, on average. And three sports—golf, tennis and baseball—that are played individually or with little contact, have an average vaccination rate of 88%. </p><p class="article__body-text">Covid-19 is causing more disruption in some sports than others. On December 20th England’s football Premier League said that 84% of players were on the “vaccination journey”, meaning that they have received at least one dose, a markedly lower proportion than in other top-tier football leagues in Europe. As the Omicron variant spread quickly across England last month some clubs were forced to postpone games because they could not field enough covid-free players. Among the league’s 20 teams, 341 players and staff have tested positive since November 29th and 17 games have been postponed. By contrast, across the four other major European leagues just two games have been postponed because of covid-19 since November. </p><p class="article__body-text">Tennis, a contactless sport which mostly takes place outdoors, might appear less risky. But the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the men’s professional body, has done much to encourage players to get jabbed. The ATP reported in late October that just 65% of its top players were fully vaccinated, but that has since risen to 95%. Yet although as a tennis player Mr Djokovic’s vaccine hesitancy is exceptional, as a Serb it is not<b>. </b>Despite there being little shortage of vaccines in Serbia, where he is from, just 45% of adults have been double-jabbed. Meanwhile, the country has been battered by the disease. According to <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates"><i>The Economist</i>‘s tracker</a> Serbia suffered the second-highest number of excess deaths in the world per head of population. With as much clout off the court as on it, Mr Djokovic’s public hesitation to take a life-saving vaccine may well be costing the lives of his countrymen. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, <a href="./.html">sign up to Off the Charts</a>, our weekly newsletter.</i></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Novak%20Djokovic%E2%80%99s%20vaccine%20hesitancy%20is%20unusual%20for%20a%20tennis%20player.%20For%20a%20Serb%20it%20is%20not&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-05&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F0g455lv82pjg7eq11dqvq15aorc101g9&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
