Inside it lay the skeletons of six people huddled together. Two were children; some bones were burned. One adult held Buddhist memorial tablets, from which they could be identified as the wife, daughter and other relatives of Shizuo Tsuzuki, who had left the shelter on an errand and was now a company president. There was the wife he had not seen for 22 years. </p><style data-emotion="css drxevm">.css-drxevm{margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;}.css-drxevm figure{margin:0;min-width:100%;}.css-drxevm figure figcaption{display:inline;font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);}.css-drxevm audio{display:block;margin-top:0.75rem;width:100%;}.css-drxevm +figure,.css-drxevm +.g-fallback+figure{margin-top:0;}</style><div class="css-drxevm e1xre6611"><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <style data-emotion="css 1fs0t47">.css-1fs0t47{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-border-link);}.css-1fs0t47 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;-webkit-transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);}.css-1fs0t47 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-1fs0t47 a:focus{text-decoration-color:transparent;box-shadow:0 0 0 0.125rem var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);outline:solid transparent;}.css-1fs0t47 a:active{text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);box-shadow:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}</style><span class="css-1fs0t47 e1ncjrms0">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</span></div><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/089%20Obituary%20-%20Saotome%20Katsumoto-22e935365c4ef5622de5525ed760f457.mp3" title="Saotome Katsumoto insisted that Japan should not forget"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio><style data-emotion="css 1tbn2ub">.css-1tbn2ub{text-align:center;height:0;}.css-1tbn2ub>div{top:-0.625rem;}</style><div class="css-1tbn2ub e1xre6610"><style data-emotion="css sl0bi6">.css-sl0bi6{position:relative;display:inline-block;text-align:left;}</style><div class="css-sl0bi6 ey1yhxa8"><style data-emotion="css 11m9t22">.css-11m9t22{z-index:98;height:40px;width:40px;position:absolute;border-radius:50%;box-shadow:0 0 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);-webkit-transform:scale(1);-moz-transform:scale(1);-ms-transform:scale(1);transform:scale(1);-webkit-animation:pulse-color 2s infinite;animation:pulse-color 2s infinite;}.css-11m9t22 circle{stroke:var(--ds-color-new-york-55);opacity:0.6;}@media (max-width: 22.4375rem){.css-11m9t22{top:calc(100% -

Saotome Katsumoto’s reaction was quite different. Here, brought into the glare of daylight, was the tragedy that had been his only subject for as long as he had been a writer: the American bombing raid on Tokyo which, on a single night in March 1945, had killed around 100,000 people and left a million homeless. A fleet of 334 <small>b</small>-29s were sent from the Marianas to destroy the Shitamachi district, a poor and densely crowded part of the city, with the aim of not only crippling Japan’s war production but, in the words of General Curtis LeMay, to wipe Tokyo off the map.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It was the most deadly single air raid in history, with casualties close to those in Hiroshima and surpassing Nagasaki, where atomic bombs were dropped. But that new-forged horror seared those two cities into public memory, whereas the fire that devastated Tokyo—the worst of dozens of raids since November 1944—was brushed aside and buried, like the skeletons on the Tozai line. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Saotome was determined to break the silence. The Great Raid had to be talked about and described in school textbooks, where it did not rate a mention. Evidence had to be gathered, both from the ground and from survivors. If no one else dared upset the Japanese government, which was unwilling to reopen any questions about the war, he would; because only he, it seemed, still carried the fire inside him. </p><p class="article__body-text">The inferno had begun with his father yelling at him, sometime in the earliest hours of March 10th 1945. He leapt from bed and pulled on his clothes: his khaki civilian uniform, then a judo robe. He also grabbed his only treasure, a cloth pouch of old coins. The family was poor, his mother a seamstress and his father, when he wasn’t drinking, a street-seller. Treasures were scarce. </p><p class="article__body-text">He was a worker too, though he was only 12 and still a runny-nosed schoolboy. He collected scrap metal for the local ironworks to make into grenades. Proudly, he wore his <i>hachimaki</i> headband with the word <i>kamikaze</i> on it, divine wind, and the red sun of Japan. In school he was taught that Japan could not lose this war, because they were all the emperor’s children and the emperor was a god. He felt doubtful about that, but of course never said so. </p><p class="article__body-text">He looked outside. The night sky was scorched crimson, and flashes of light seemed to pass behind his eyelids. His mother was fussing and gathering up cooking pots; his father was shouting that they had to evacuate. Fire was already consuming Shitamachi, where they all lived cheek-by-jowl in wooden houses. It took only 12 minutes for one of those houses to burn down.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">With their stuff piled on a handcart, they struggled down the street: himself, his parents and his two sisters. People were crowding and shouting everywhere, pushing from every side. But so was the fire, chasing them like a living thing. Alleyways were blocked with blazing futons, and molten glass hung from windows. The heat was so intense that if they passed a water-bucket his father would douse them all, but in moments his judo robe was dry again. The wind, a strong north-wester rather than the <i>kamikaze</i> they needed, fiercely fanned the flames.</p><p class="article__body-text">Afterwards, when they had all miraculously survived, he remembered the dreadful futility of that night. His father carried a bamboo water-gun, a bigger version of a child’s toy, with the imperial chrysanthemum crest. A posse of neighbours, outside their shelters, wielded bamboo fire brooms. A paper notice on the gate of the ironworks urged workers: “Don’t be put off by such a little thing!” But nothing mattered in the end except water and life. </p><p class="article__body-text">With the eye of a budding writer, he also noticed incongruous beauties. The flames, reflected in the underbellies of the <small>b</small>-29s, looked like tropical fish swimming in the sky; as he ran, sparks darted round him like swallows. But horror ruled: a man beside him instantly decapitated, bomb-blasts wrenching children from parents, and the sight with the dawn of dozens of charred bodies being dragged, with hooked poles, out of the Sumida river. </p><p class="article__body-text">That night made him a pacifist, and in the name of pacifism he needed to live and relive, record and teach, how terrible war was. Since 1952, he had written novels and children’s books based on the raid. After 1970, when a professor told him that only historical evidence would keep the raid in the public eye, he began systematically, with notebook and pen, to gather the memories of other survivors. Eventually he turned their painful, halting conversations into six published volumes of recollections. </p><p class="article__body-text">He accepted that, fundamentally, Japan was to blame for what had happened and for the Asia-Pacific war itself. He had no animus against Americans, except for LeMay, who was given the Order of the Rising Sun for rebuilding Japan’s air force; and even that he held more against Japan, for being so craven. But the raid of March 10th was, for him, an obvious breach of international law. </p><p class="article__body-text">He hoped the government would help his cause, but was disappointed. No help was offered to civilian survivors. In 2002 he opened his Centre of the Tokyo Raid and War Damage, filled with relics, maps and manuscripts, but it had to be built on a modest scale, with private funds, on the edge of the city. Clearly he hadn’t said, or gathered, or written enough. </p><p class="article__body-text">As for his chief ambition, to end war, that was also far off. In his last weeks he watched footage of Ukrainians fleeing their country; and saw among them still the figures of men and women fleeing Shitamachi as it burned, pushing their handcarts, screaming after their children, indelible as ever. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
