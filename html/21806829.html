But any supporters of Boris Johnson who may be tempted to fall back on that excuse for the increasingly feeble grip of his premiership would be guilty of self-delusion. Britain’s prime minister is facing a double crisis. One half of this is the growing sense that he is temperamentally unfit to hold the highest office in the land. The other is the fear that his government will be incapable of bringing about the reforms it has promised—some of which Britain badly needs.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21806829.mp3" title="Something has broken in Boris Johnson’s government"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The depths of Mr Johnson’s difficulties became clear on December 14th, when 99 Conservative <small>MP</small>s voted against his “Plan B” to deal with the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/12/11/early-data-on-omicron-show-surging-cases-but-milder-symptoms">Omicron variant</a>. It was one of the largest-ever rebellions against a Conservative prime minister and it put Mr Johnson in the unsustainable position of depending upon the opposition Labour Party for one of his government’s central policies. Two days later, as <em>The Economist </em>went to press, voters were about to have their say in a <a href="./do-by-election-defeats-spell-the-end-of-british-governments.html">by-election</a> in North Shropshire, the truest of blue seats. A collapse of the Conservative majority looked assured. There was even the possibility of defeat.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Whatever the verdict in North Shropshire, Mr Johnson is looking personally wounded. He has always been accident-prone, but he has usually matched this with an extraordinary knack for wriggling out of trouble. When lesser politicians bluster and contradict themselves, voters sneer at their sleaze, lying and hypocrisy. By contrast, Mr Johnson has had an uncanny ability to make them feel as if they are in on the joke.</p><p class="article__body-text">But his greatest political gift is failing him. First, sleaze cut through to ordinary voters. In November Mr Johnson <a href="./britains-government-goes-to-disgraceful-lengths-to-protect-a-tory-mp.html">tried to save</a> Owen Paterson, then <small>MP</small> for that North Shropshire seat, from being censured for breaking the rules over paid lobbying. (The prime minister said that to punish him would offend natural justice.) The next to cut through was lying. This month it emerged that, whereas Mr Johnson had claimed to know nothing about who paid for a renovation of his Downing Street flat, which cost £112,549 ($150,000), he had in fact been asking for money from the man who turned out to be the donor. (Number 10 says that appearances are deceptive.) And most recently it was hypocrisy. A video showed senior aides joking about one of several parties held in Downing Street last Christmas, when the rest of the country was locked down with only the television for company. (Mr Johnson said he knew nothing of it.)</p><p class="article__body-text">What matters more to Britain than the fact that the prime minister’s spell over voters has broken is his government’s diminished capacity for reform. Mr Johnson’s pitch in the election of 2019 was that post-Brexit Britain would no longer be a divided, unequal country. Power and prosperity would flow from the metropolitan elite to left-behind places that would be “levelled up”. His was a radical new type of Conservatism, popular but not populist.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The revolution never happened, and not just because the pandemic got in the way. Brexit stumbles on, zombie-like, in an endless struggle over the future of Northern Ireland. Policymaking has seized up or, as with reforms to planning law, been abandoned altogether. A campaign to warn against the dangers of Scottish independence has died. Levelling up has come to encompass everything, so it means nothing. True, a drive to weaken judicial oversight, limit free speech and protest, and make the police less accountable trundles forward. But such illiberalism is hardly a glorious tribute to Britain’s post-Brexit sovereignty.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <a data-tegid="ihlbh3bgoc0ba0jr1qdg4hmind0kahdu" href="./the-omicron-variant-advances-at-an-incredible-rate.html">viciousness of Omicron</a> could yet vindicate the urgency behind Plan B. The lack of a Tory challenger—and of a strong opposition—could win Mr Johnson re-election in 2024. Even so recent weeks mark a new phase in his premiership. Once lost, voters’ trust is hard to recover. When a government and its party are ragged, they are hard to reunite. If reform loses focus and purpose, it is hard to jump-start. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on December 15th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "Broken promises"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Something%20has%20broken%20in%20Boris%20Johnson%E2%80%99s%20government&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-16&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fqgk6h6o4tclgm0r729us2v3oin1rb4h4&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
