Dams at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, reservoirs filled with the river’s water, generate power for more than 4m people. But a mixture of <a href="/united-states/the-american-west-is-drying-up/21803608">climate change and poor policy</a> choices is bleeding the area dry. The lakes are dangerously close to “dead pool” levels, the point at which water stops flowing downstream from the dams (see chart). Were that to happen, it would wreak havoc on supplies of water and energy. Last year officials declared the river’s first ever water shortage. On August 16th they raised it to a more severe threat level, triggering mandatory cuts to how much water can be used by several areas in the Colorado river basin. </p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="20220820_WOC924_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">The new cuts are in addition to previous drought-contingency<!-- --> plans laid out by the Biden administration. By next year seven states that sit within the basin are supposed to decrease their dependency on the river by up to 4m acre-feet (4.9bn cubic metres) of water. That is equivalent to around one third of the river’s annual flow—or almost all of California’s annual usage.</p><p class="article__body-text">The federal intervention highlights the severity of the 23-year megadrought, the worst the area has known in at least 1,200 years. The river’s level has dropped by 20% since the 1900s, and is now well below what is needed to sustain the basin. Precipitation and <a href="/united-states/2021/12/11/late-snowfall-in-the-american-west-is-part-of-pattern">melting snowpack</a> can help replenish the river each spring, but the overall water level of the reservoirs is in decline. </p><p class="article__body-text">If the basin states are unable to adjust their water usage, the crisis will worsen. As snowpack in the American West shrinks, future droughts will last longer, more water will evaporate (meaning the river’s levels will drop further), and farmland will go unwatered: 80% of the water from the Colorado river is used for agriculture. Time is running out to save one of America’s largest water sources. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body><script>
