But so bad is the infighting it should be named after the similar hues of Afghanistan’s flag, chuckles Oliver Kirchner, local head of the hard-right Alternative for Germany (<small>A</small>f<small>D</small>).</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/germanys-christian-democrats-struggle-against-populists-in-the-east.mp3" title="Germany’s Christian Democrats struggle against populists in the east"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">He should know. Five years ago the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>—an extremist outfit shunned by all other parties—won a quarter of the vote, forcing the Kenya trio into their ill-matched arrangement. The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>’s enduring support could oblige them to keep it going after Saxony-Anhalt’s election on June 6th.</p><p class="article__body-text">Parts of this state offer a grimly familiar east German tale of deindustrialisation, depopulation and resentment of know-it-all <em>Wessis </em>(westerners). The <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>’s strength in such places gives the <small>CDU</small>, which leads the federal government, a persistent headache. The weird coalitions it dictates are bad enough: Saxony-Anhalt’s government has often teetered on the verge of breakdown. In Brandenburg and Saxony the <small>A</small>f<small>D’</small>s<!-- --> muscle has forced the <small>CDU</small> into similar awkward contraptions.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210605_EUM928.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20210605_EUM928.png" srcset="../image/20210605_EUM928.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">But many in the <small>CDU</small>, in Saxony-Anhalt and other eastern states, also bitterly resent the <em>cordon sanitaire </em>their leaders have erected around the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. Perhaps a third of the <small>CDU</small>’s <small>MP</small>s in Saxony-Anhalt would prefer to work with the populists, reckons Wolfgang Renzsch, professor emeritus at the University of Magdeburg. Many regularly flirt with <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> policies, most recently in December during a row over <small>TV</small>-licence fees that nearly toppled the government. (That episode, like others before it, was defused by Reiner Haseloff, the wily <small>CDU</small> premier.) Concerned <small>CDU</small> members have circulated a letter to colleagues urging them to hold the line against the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">Eastern states are small, but their dramas still resonate. Last year in Thuringia the local arm of the <small>CDU</small> backed a premier also supported by the <small>A</small>f<small>D.</small> The furore finished off Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, at the time the <small>CDU</small>’s national leader and Angela Merkel’s heir apparent. Her successor, Armin Laschet, takes a robust stance against the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. This message is likely to carry Mr Haseloff to a narrow victory over the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>, giving Mr Laschet a tailwind for September’s federal election. Yet he faces a dilemma: the <small>CDU</small>’s main rival in the west is the Green party, but in the east it is the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. This pair are poles apart. <small>CDU</small> wallahs admit that this makes it hard to find a consistent national message.</p><p class="article__body-text">One idea is simply to write off a chunk of the eastern vote. Last week Marco Wanderwitz, the government’s commissioner for eastern Germany, revived an old debate by claiming that some of the electorate there had been “socialised by dictatorship” and did not understand democracy. Other parties, he said, should leave them to the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small> and await a new generation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet 30 years after German reunification, the <small>A</small>f<small>D’</small>s strength suggests it cannot just be waited out. In the east it is more popular among younger voters than older ones. And it always manages to find a popular theme, sighs Sven Schulze, the <small>CDU</small>’s chair in Saxony-Anhalt: ten years ago it was the euro; five years ago refugees; now covid-19. (Mr Kirchner has vowed to launch investigations into what he argues was an excessive lockdown.) The <small>CDU</small> leadership is determined to lock out the <small>A</small>f<small>D</small>. But it still has no remedy for its eastern headache. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "Deny the Alternative"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Germany%E2%80%99s%20Christian%20Democrats%20struggle%20against%20populists%20in%20the%20east&amp;publicationDate=2021-06-05&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fj45r5gj2th9rdmibk7sn4vh5t3ppcje7&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
