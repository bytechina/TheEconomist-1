The earliest evidence of political polling comes from America’s presidential election of 1824, in which unscientific surveys—called “straw polls” by pollsters today—were taken at various public gatherings.</p><p class="article__body-text">Nearly 200 years later election forecasting is much more scientific. On September 7th <i>The Economist</i> launched its <a href="./senate.html">forecasting model</a> for America’s <a href="./mid-terms-2022.html">midterm elections</a>. It assesses both the national political environment and the nuances of each House and Senate race. How does it work?</p><p class="article__body-text">For House elections, the single best indicator is polls—particularly the “generic-ballot” question, which asks Americans which party they want to control Congress. We look at other factors, too. If the party controlling the White House is doing better than expected in special elections, which are contests held between general elections to fill vacant seats, that bodes well for their odds in the midterms. But we also account for the midterm penalty: parties tend to lose votes in the election after they win the White House.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In the House, we also need to know the politics of every congressional district. We train statistical models to assess other factors—known as “fundamentals”—that influence vote share. Seats that were more left-leaning (or more right-leaning) than the national popular vote in previous elections are likelier to be so again in future ones, for example. If candidates raise vastly more money in campaign contributions than their opponents, that tends to boost their vote, too.</p><p class="article__body-text">Polls of individual races help nudge forecasts closer to expectations. It helps to make a few adjustments to these surveys before averaging them together. Polls conducted closer to election day receive more weight, and surveys are adjusted for changes in the national political environment since they were taken, such as a party whose position in generic-ballot polls has improved. We also weight the polls by the historical record of the pollster that conducted them; firms that routinely over- or under-estimate a certain party receive less weight than others.</p><p class="article__body-text">Our forecasts for the Senate work similarly, although the models are trained separately from those for the House. We find that the quality of candidates matters more in Senate races, for instance—they are perhaps less moored to the politics of a seat than in the House.</p><p class="article__body-text">The last step is to account for the uncertainty of our projections. We do this by making forecasts for all competitive House and Senate races in our database. Then we train a final set of models to estimate the uncertainty in each race. That depends on factors such as the share of swing, or undecided, voters.</p><p class="article__body-text">Armed with a set of projections and estimated uncertainty in each race, we calculate the probability of each party winning each chamber. We do this by simulating the national election tens of thousands of times. Each time we calculate what our national projection would have shown if national and individual forecasts were wrong. Each simulation thus represents a hypothetical environment in which the election takes place. What happens if Democrats beat their polls—or underperform? What if incumbency or fundraising is not worth as much as in the past? And on and on, until we have a predicted outcome.
