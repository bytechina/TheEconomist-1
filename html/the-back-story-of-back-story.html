A reality-TV star became the leader of the free world. An actor who played a fictional president in a Ukrainian comedy show was elected to be the real one. The news is a rolling row over whose statues should be pulled down, whether and which books should be pulped, which artists ought to be feted and who is beyond the pale. Depending on your perspective, “cancel culture”, that dismal oxymoron, is a grave threat to civilisation, or an overdue movement for justice, or a spectre got up by populists as a distraction from their failings.<br/><br/>The worlds of politics, and of entertainment and the arts, seem to be enmeshed as never before. But then, they always have been—especially in times of flux and upheaval. Today’s controversies over protesting athletes, or how history should be taught in schools, seem new but aren’t. Clashes like these have a long back story.<br/><br/>One of the most insightful takes on the relationship between politics and culture comes in “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction”, an essay by Walter Benjamin that was published in 1935. Fascism was turning politics into an aesthetic experience, he argued, a process bound to “culminate in one thing: war”. Already, mankind stood primed to “experience its own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure”. Communism’s response, as he saw it, was to politicise art.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Benjamin’s ideas had a back story. A German Jew who had fallen in love with a Latvian actress and followed her to Moscow, he wrote the essay during a final, doomed exile from Berlin. In retrospect, he was onto something about fascism, communism and art. Bigwig Nazis may have reached for their revolvers when they heard the word “culture”; Josef Stalin, perhaps the most fearsome cultural critic in history, reached for a pen or the telephone, and sometimes his secret police. In 1936 he stormed out of a performance of “Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District”, an electrifying opera by Dmitri Shostakovich; the unsigned review that appeared in <em>Pravda</em> two days later, headlined “Muddle Instead of Music”, almost did for the composer. A decade later Stalin was irked by the reception given to Anna Akhmatova, a poet, at a recital in Moscow. “Who organised the standing ovation?” he reputedly growled.<br/><br/>Stalin’s meddling in the arts also had a back story, involving his inferiority complex towards writers and intellectuals. But though the life-and-death consequences of his interest in culture were extreme, his view of it as an extension of politics was universal during the cold war, when the West exfiltrated Soviet ballet-dancers and smuggled books the other way. Indeed, this has been the attitude of the powerful from ancient Rome to the Chinese Communist Party. Shakespeare’s plays are stuffed with radical sentiments that could have got him hung, drawn and quartered—had he not put them in the mouths of a delirious king, or a teenage lover, or a nameless but heroic servant. Most of what there is to know about demagoguery is contained in “Julius Caesar”. On the surface, however, Shakespeare’s histories are dutiful Tudor propaganda. <br/><br/>This symbiosis between politics and the arts is one reason <em>The Economist</em> is introducing Back Story, a new biweekly culture column. Culture is a serious business, distilling as it does the thoughts of the age on what the world looks like, how to think about it, how to think in general. It is also meant to be uplifting and enjoyable, and that is serious business, too. From box sets on the sofa to pilgrimages to Bayreuth, billions of spare hours are devoted to it, along with billions in spare income. Back Story aims to encompass the fun and the profound, both movie stars and semiotics, unpicking the zeitgeist, sharing enthusiasms, spotlighting important authors and performers, from country musicians to conceptual artists, Netflix to novels. <br/><br/>Part of the job of Back Story will be to distinguish the back story from the foreground; the ephemera from what matters, and might last. That can be tricky. What, in the end, is the essence of “Casablanca” (pictured)—the ineffable dialogue, the tragic love affair between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, the fact that many of the characters washed up at Rick's gin joint were played by real-life refugees, or the film’s role in reassuring Americans, not long after they entered the second world war, that fighting it was necessary? In matters of art, as of life, what is the subplot and what the main event? Only time can really tell. But a column can make a stab at it.</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20back%20story%20of%20Back%20Story&amp;publicationDate=2021-08-20&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fpbbake4ejqktla4adkgcdsiusbg0orfs&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
