The tangle of cables in the boot is a reminder of the need to plug in and recharge cars roughly every 250 miles (400km). And when you do find a <a href="./21806663.html">public charging point</a>, it is sometimes damaged or inaccessible. Little wonder that one of the main reasons drivers give for not buying an <small>EV</small> is “range anxiety”.</p><p class="article__body-text">A society-wide switch from hydrocarbons to electrons is required if the world is to stand a chance of reaching its net-zero emissions targets. However as <small>EV</small>s become more common, the charging problem will become more severe. Today’s mostly wealthy owners can often plug in their <small>EV</small> at home or at work. But many less-well-off <small>EV</small> drivers will not have a drive in front of their house or a space in the executive car park.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/468/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211211_LDC164.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211211_LDC164.png" srcset="../image/20211211_LDC164.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">By 2040 around 60% of all charging will need to take place away from home, requiring a vast public network of charging stations. At the end of 2020 the world had just 1.3m of these public chargers. By some estimates, to meet net- zero emissions goals by 2050 will require 200m of the things.</p><p class="article__body-text">Who might install them? Drivers will need a mix of fast “long-distance” chargers installed near motorways that can rapidly add hundreds of miles to battery ranges and slower “top-up” chargers available at kerbsides or in the car parks of shopping centres, restaurants and so on. The private sector, sensing an opportunity to make some money from surging <small>EV</small> ownership, is already showing an interest. Dedicated charging firms and carmakers are investing in infrastructure. Oil companies, with Shell to the fore, are putting chargers in petrol stations and buying charging companies. Utilities, which have plenty of electricity to sell, are also starting to sniff around.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet the charging business suffers from big problems. One is how to co-ordinate between the owners of charging points, the owners of the sites where they will be installed, planning authorities and grid firms. Another is the cost. According to one estimate, the bill for the chargers needed to reach net-zero by 2050 will be $1.6trn. To start with, profits may be elusive because the networks will not at first be heavily used. A related risk is that the coverage will have gaps. California is a choice spot for installing chargers, but is anyone keen on investing in Nebraska? And then there is the question of competing networks. Drivers should be able to switch from one to the other without the hassle of having to sign up to them all.</p><p class="article__body-text">What to do? Governments are experimenting. As well as subsidising <small>EV</small> sales many are throwing cash at public chargers. America’s infrastructure law sets aside $7.5bn to create 500,000 public stations by 2030. Britain plans to require new buildings to install chargers. Yet the sums are puny and the problems of co-ordination, coverage and convenience will remain.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Governments should learn from telecoms. Most countries auction or issue a limited number of licences or spectrum rights to firms to run regional and national mobile networks. In return the firms have to build networks according to a schedule, offer universal coverage and compete with each other. Regulators set rules to allow roaming between them.</p><p class="article__body-text">This approach has its flaws. Poorly designed auctions in Eur ope left firms with too much debt, and competition has become less intense in America. But in the past two decades the world has marshalled over $4trn of spending on telecoms infrastructure. And the mobile phone has turned from a shiny object for rich people into something in everyone’s pocket. The bright sparks running climate policy should take note. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of climate change, register for <a href="./page-not-found.html">The Climate Issue</a>, our fortnightly newsletter, or visit our <a href="./page-not-found.html">climate-change hub</a></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "Plugging the gap"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20tricky%20business%20of%20charging%20electric%20cars&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fuphust30gav2o1t82cnm2170hf6e1ni3&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
