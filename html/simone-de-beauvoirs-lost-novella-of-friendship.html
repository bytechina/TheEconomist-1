Translated by Sandra Smith. <em>Ecco; 176 pages; $26.99.</em> Published in Britain as “The Inseparables”.

On the first day of the school year, de Beauvoir found that “the seat next to mine was occupied by a new girl: she was small, dark, thin-faced, with short hair.” Lacoin explained that she had been confined to her bed for a year after her dress caught fire and she suffered terrible burns. De Beauvoir was captivated by the story, and by her. “Nothing as important as that had ever happened to me,” she later wrote. Lacoin “seemed to me a very finished person…everything she had to say was either interesting or amusing.”</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/simone-de-beauvoirs-lost-novella-of-friendship.mp3" title="Simone de Beauvoir’s lost novella of friendship"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The pair quickly became firm friends—dubbed “the two inseparables” by their teachers—as well as academic rivals. They would sneak into Lacoin’s father’s study, not to exchange “girlish confidences” but to talk about their reading and schoolwork, or lofty ideas such as the definition of love. They remained close until university.</p><p class="article__body-text">Though de Beauvoir’s family had once belonged to the <em>haute bourgeoisie</em>, her father had mismanaged their money, and she was expected to succeed academically and support herself. In Lacoin’s family, however, education was seen as a distraction—eventually “you either had to get married or become a nun.” De Beauvoir’s friend “began to dread the future”. In the end, Lacoin was denied a choice of any kind: she died of a brain infection in 1929. When de Beauvoir wrote the date in her diary, she blotted the ink with her tears.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It was one of the most important relationships of the feminist philosopher’s life; Sylvie Le Bon de Beauvoir, her adopted daughter, has described it as “her first great love affair”. De Beauvoir loved Zaza (Lacoin’s nickname) “with an intensity which could not be accounted for by any established set of rules”. Time and again, she would try to immortalise her friend on the page: as Anne in “When Things of the Spirit Come First”, a collection of short stories (written in 1937 but not published until 1979); in a passage, later deleted, in “The Mandarins” (1954), for which she won the Prix Goncourt, France’s most prestigious literary award; and in her memoirs.</p><p class="article__body-text">She produced another version of the story, too. De Beauvoir wrote “Inseparable”, a thinly fictionalised account of the friendship, in 1954 but hid it in a drawer. Jean-Paul Sartre, her romantic and intellectual partner, considered such personal material uninteresting and dissuaded her from publishing it. Discovered by her daughter, the novella was released in French last year and is now out in English.</p><h2>The marriage plot</h2><p class="article__body-text">Some of it will be familiar to admirers. The book begins with Sylvie (de Beauvoir’s avatar) meeting Andrée (Lacoin’s) at school and a description of the accident; it ends with Andrée’s untimely death. In between it points up the strictures of decorum-obsessed bourgeois society, and reveals Andrée’s thwarted courtship with Pascal (in real life Maurice Merleau-Ponty, another philosopher) and her parents’ painful disapproval of it. The context in the memoir is stripped away, leaving only a poignant tale of intense affection. “I could only conceive of one kind of love,” Sylvie reflects. “The love I had for her.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The book distils subjects that would preoccupy de Beauvoir throughout her career. “It gives us such a great insight into the formation of one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century,” says Charlotte Knight, its British editor. One theme is religion. Through Sylvie, the author examines her own rejection of the church and loss of faith. “Without God, the world no doubt was difficult to explain,” Sylvie says, “but God didn’t explain very much, or at any rate we understood very little.”</p><p class="article__body-text">De Beauvoir would probe the meaning of self-determination and freedom in “The Ethics of Ambiguity”, a defence of existentialism published in 1947. “Man exists,” she wrote. “For him it is not a question of wondering whether his presence in the world is useful…It is a matter of knowing whether he wants to live and under what conditions.” Andrée, meanwhile, is urged to believe in self-sacrifice, an idea de Beauvoir “wrestled with for much of her life”, says Kate Kirkpatrick of Oxford University, author of “Becoming Beauvoir”, a biography.</p><p class="article__body-text">Lacoin’s story also informed her feminism. In “The Second Sex” (1949), de Beauvoir wrote that a young woman “has a harder time than the young man in accomplishing herself as an autonomous individual”. She lamented the fact that “marriage is the reference by which the single woman is defined” and the bourgeois fondness for arranged, loveless unions—an outcome Lacoin was desperate to avoid. In a scene described at length in the novella and briefly in “The Second Sex”, Andrée/Lacoin brings an axe down on her foot to secure a reprieve from the drudgery of domestic labour and familial obligations.</p><p class="article__body-text">As Lauren Elkin, the translator of the British edition, notes, women had typically married or died at the end of novels. In hers, de Beauvoir indicts the society and institutions that “make those Andrée’s only two options”. At the funeral, the imagery of the two fates is conflated as her grave is shrouded with pale flowers. She “suffocated in all this whiteness”, Sylvie observes.</p><p class="article__body-text">This lost novella will introduce some readers to the defining role Lacoin played in de Beauvoir’s trailblazing life and career. The philosopher herself, who died in 1986, always understood it. At the end of her memoir, she says she is haunted by visions of her friend at night and by her memory during the day. “We had fought together against the revolting fate that had lain ahead,” she writes, “and for a long time I believed that I had paid for my own freedom with her death.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline "Her brilliant friend"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Simone%20de%20Beauvoir%E2%80%99s%20lost%20novella%20of%20friendship&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ff3qu9dbanoodumj2tcb2fgsq7var2l43&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
