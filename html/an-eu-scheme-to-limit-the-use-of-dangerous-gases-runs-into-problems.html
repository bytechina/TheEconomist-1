In a move cheered by climate activists, the European Union began in 2015 to restrict the production and import of gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (<small>HFC</small>s). <small>HFC</small>s are widely used in refrigeration, air-conditioning and manufacturing, but they are also potent greenhouse gases. The first big shortages hit in early 2018. Prices across Europe multiplied sixfold or even more. The <small>EU</small> wanted to push <small>HFC</small> users to adopt pricey, climate-friendlier alternatives. It thought that the engineered shortage would do the trick.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <span class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</span></div><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/an-eu-scheme-to-limit-the-use-of-dangerous-gases-runs-into-problems.mp3" title="An EU scheme to limit the use of dangerous gases runs into problems"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p class="article__body-text">But officials were soon scratching their heads. The high prices unexpectedly plummeted. And even though the <small>EU</small> tightened caps on <small>HFC</small>s again a year ago, prices are still not much higher than before the crunch. The reason: <small>HFC</small>s were being smuggled into the <small>EU</small>. The trafficking is still going on. The Environmental Investigation Agency, a watchdog based in London that has dispatched researchers to pose as buyers in Romania, estimates that a quarter of all <small>HFC</small>s in the <small>EU</small> are contraband. A body formed by chemical companies, the European FluoroCarbons Technical Committee (<small>EFCTC</small>), says the proportion may be as high as a third.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Such estimates are rough. But they have not been plucked from thin air. Much can be inferred, for example, by examining officially registered trade flows. Data from Turkish sources show that in 2020 more than four times as much <small>HFC</small> tonnage left Turkey bound for the <small>EU</small> than the latter reported as imported. This suggests that plenty of tanks and canisters holding <small>HFC</small>s enter on the sly.</p><p class="article__body-text">The smuggling has hit some firms particularly hard. To supply greener alternatives to <small>HFC</small>s, Chemours, an American firm, spent around $500m on <small>R</small>&amp;<small>D</small> and production facilities. But with illegal imports continuing to hold down <small>HFC</small> prices, demand for alternatives has been “stagnating” and even declining, laments Murli Sukhwani of Chemour’s European <small>HQ</small> in Geneva. Mr Sukhwani, who also leads the <small>EFCTC</small>’s investigation into the black market, says climate-friendly alternative gases cost at least twice as much as the compounds they are supposed to replace.</p><p class="article__body-text">This has miffed America. In a report last year on barriers to trade, Katherine Tai, the American trade representative, wrote that the <small>EU</small>’s “insufficient oversight and enforcement” of its <small>HFC</small> caps is hurting American chemical firms, not to mention the climate. European officials, for their part, point to the difficulty of preventing profitable contraband from crossing the bloc’s long borders.</p><p class="article__body-text">Consider the potential earnings, says Marco Buoni, president of an association of European refrigeration and air-conditioning contractors called <small>AREA</small>. When prices first soared, a car boot could be filled in Ukraine with canisters of an <small>HFC</small> blend called R404A that would sell, hours later, for ten times as much in Poland. Margins have since shrunk as legions have got in on the action. But contraband <small>HFC</small>s are still so valuable that canisters are sometimes given space on boats trafficking migrants from north Africa to Europe.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Some trafficking is carried out by moonlighters who make border runs in their cars or hide canisters in luggage stowed on passenger coaches. But the black market is now dominated by crime syndicates that move large volumes, says the European Anti-Fraud Office (<small>OLAF</small>). Most of the contraband seems to come from China, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text">One trick is to mislabel with stickers that are later peeled off. To detect the practice, which became widespread in 2019, expensive gas-analysis equipment is needed, says an <small>OLAF</small> investigator. Another approach is to falsely declare that a shipment of <small>HFC</small>s will be subsequently exported out of the <small>EU</small>. These “transiting” goods are not subject to <small>EU</small> limits on imports, but the stuff often disappears, the investigator says, into “a very, very difficult to track” succession of warehouses across Europe. Trafficking has been exacerbated by generally light penalties. Fines of a few thousand euros have been common.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>EFCTC</small> is trying to improve enforcement. It has hired Kroll, an American firm, to gather intelligence on potential smuggling and pass it along to authorities. The team, which is based in London, uses network-analysis software to unearth hidden relationships between entities in myriad sources of data. In one success, the software drew attention to a lorry driver hauling gas from Turkey into the <small>EU</small>. In a video posted online, he unwisely mentioned his “friends at the border”. He was later nabbed. Recent months have seen “a lot of arrests and a lot of action”, especially involving Romania and Turkey, says Benedict Hamilton, leader of the Kroll team.</p><p class="article__body-text">But the outlook nonetheless remains grim, according to Marius Appenzeller, refrigerants manager at Westfalen Group, a gases distributor based in Münster, Germany. The firm expects trafficking to increase as the <small>EU</small> continues, every three years until 2030, to shrink <small>HFC</small> quotas. A report in December from the European Environment Agency acknowledged that <small>HFC</small> use had begun to grow, even without taking into account “alleged” smuggling. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of climate change, register for <a href="./https://www.economist.com/theclimateissue/.html">The Climate Issue</a>, our fortnightly newsletter, or visit our <a href="./page-not-found.html">climate-change hub</a></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "Free as air"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=An%20EU%20scheme%20to%20limit%20the%20use%20of%20dangerous%20gases%20runs%20into%20problems&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-25&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fuf8umjr2elt6v6edh764omb6k3fiehc4&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
