The fertility rate, which can be thought of as the number of children a woman will have during her lifetime, stands at just 1.65. Life-expectancy projections are increasingly pessimistic, too. Interim data published on January 12th by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimate that the population will increase by just 3% in the decade to 2030. In the decade to 2020 it grew by 7%. Meanwhile, the number of people aged 85 and over will rise sharply (see chart). In mid-2020 fewer than 2m were in that age bracket. Projections suggest that by 2045 the figure will be more than 3m. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">As in other rich countries, women are <a href="/britain/2021/10/14/in-britain-childlessness-seems-likely-to-return-to-1920s-levels">having fewer children</a>: after the sharp peak that followed the second world war, fertility rates have declined. And the big baby-boom generation is affecting demographics in Britain and beyond. In Japan, the <i>dankai no sedai</i>—those born between 1947 and 1949—have contributed to the country’s <a href="/special-report/2021/12/07/an-ageing-country-shows-others-how-to-manage">rapid ageing</a>: almost 30% of the population are aged over 65. The slowdown in life-expectancy increase is also weighing on Britain’s population growth. Projections made since 2012 (see chart 2) have steadily revised down period life expectancy at birth (a measure of the average number of years people will live beyond their current age). For someone born in 2025, the latest projected life expectancy is 2.1 years lower than the projection made in 2012.</p><p class="article__body-text">This slow-growing, ageing population will come at a cost. The number of adults of pensionable age for every 1,000 working-age people is projected to increase from 280 in mid-2020 to 341 by mid-2045. Other rich countries face even worse ratios. The European Union average for the same measure is projected to increase from 340 in 2019 to 590 in 2070. </p><p class="article__body-text">However reluctant they may be to do so, countries with ageing populations will have to look beyond their borders. Migration has been a key source of population growth in Britain for decades but Ridhi Kashyap, a demographer at the University of Oxford, believes it will play an even more important role in the future. “Given the grim mortality scenario and the revised downward estimates for fertility, migration is just becoming more salient,” she says. All of this means anti-immigration governments are storing up trouble for the future. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to <a href="/graphic-detail/2022/01/13/americas-entrepreneurial-boom-continued-apace-in-2021">Off the Charts</a>, our weekly newsletter.</i></p></div></body><script>
