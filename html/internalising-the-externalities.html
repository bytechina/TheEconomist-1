Francesco Datini, the 14th-century “Merchant of Prato” left behind hundreds of thousands of business and personal letters, ledgers and documents showing how he had made his fortune trading arms, spices and wine. As James O’Toole, a retired professor of business ethics, writes in his book “The Enlightened Capitalists”, they showed Datini to be an “astute, shrewd, ambitious, ruthless and greedy entrepreneur…filled throughout his life with constant anxiety”. But his cares got the better of him and before his death he left a fortune to endow a foundation for the benefit of the poor of Prato. It still exists over 600 years later. </p><style data-emotion="css drxevm">.css-drxevm{margin:1.3125rem 0 2.1875rem;}.css-drxevm figure{margin:0;min-width:100%;}.css-drxevm figure figcaption{display:inline;font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);}.css-drxevm audio{display:block;margin-top:0.75rem;width:100%;}.css-drxevm +figure,.css-drxevm +.g-fallback+figure{margin-top:0;}</style><div class="css-drxevm e1xre6611"><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <style data-emotion="css 1fs0t47">.css-1fs0t47{display:inline;font-family:var(--ds-type-system-sans);font-size:var(--ds-type-scale-0);font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:var(--ds-type-leading-border-link);}.css-1fs0t47 a{color:var(--ds-color-london-5);-webkit-text-decoration:underline;text-decoration:underline;text-underline-offset:0.125rem;-webkit-transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);transition:color var(--ds-interactions-transition),color var(--ds-interactions-transition);}.css-1fs0t47 a:hover{color:var(--ds-color-chicago-30);}.css-1fs0t47 a:focus{text-decoration-color:transparent;box-shadow:0 0 0 0.125rem var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);outline:solid transparent;}.css-1fs0t47 a:active{text-decoration-color:var(--ds-color-hong-kong-55);box-shadow:none;color:var(--ds-color-london-5);}</style><span class="css-1fs0t47 e1ncjrms0">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</span></div><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/061%20Special%20report%20-%20Companies-cf29e242dcce897b203a814d87846cb8.mp3" title="Internalising the externalities"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio><style data-emotion="css 1tbn2ub">.css-1tbn2ub{text-align:center;height:0;}.css-1tbn2ub>div{top:-0.625rem;}</style><div class="css-1tbn2ub e1xre6610"><style data-emotion="css sl0bi6">.css-sl0bi6{position:relative;display:inline-block;text-align:left;}</style><div class="css-sl0bi6 ey1yhxa8"><style data-emotion="css 1sbpzh1">.css-1sbpzh1{z-index:95;height:40px;width:40px;position:absolute;border-radius:50%;box-shadow:0 0 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);-webkit-transform:scale(1);-moz-transform:scale(1);-ms-transform:scale(1);transform:scale(1);-webkit-animation:pulse-color 2s infinite;animation:pulse-color 2s infinite;}.css-1sbpzh1 circle{stroke:var(--ds-color-new-york-55);opacity:0.6;}@media (max-width: 22.4375rem){.css-1sbpzh1{top:calc(100% -

His conclusion is that however successful such ventures can be under their founders, it is hard to keep the missionary zeal going—especially if they become publicly traded entities. Investors seldom have the patience to stick with a commitment to virtue. “<i>Difficile est bonum esse,</i>” he writes.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Yet do-goodery has become all the rage. That is most obvious from the embrace of stakeholder capitalism, which redefines corporate success as serving not just shareholders but employees, suppliers and the wider community. Led by Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase <small>ceo</small> who chaired the Business Roundtable, a lobby group, when it embraced the concept in 2019, company bosses have used their commitment to social causes to speak out on issues ranging from racial inclusion to gay rights to climate change.</p><p class="article__body-text">Sometimes, as when Disney protested against Florida’s “Don’t say gay” bill, enraging the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, this can stir a backlash that is not good for the bottom line. But it has become mainstream enough that Alex Edmans, of London Business School, is incorporating stakeholder capitalism into the next edition of “Principles of Corporate Finance”, a bible for financial practitioners. As he acknowledges in his book “Grow The Pie”, it is not as radical a departure as its advocates suggest. Milton Friedman, the economist often criticised for preaching shareholder primacy, argued that the social responsibility of business was to reward owners by increasing profits. But if those shareholders wanted the company to have a more social purpose, so be it. </p><p class="article__body-text"><small>esg</small> is often mixed up with stakeholderism—but there is another way to think about it. Part of its mission is to measure and disclose things that firms and their customers turn a blind eye to. The list includes the impact of commercial activities on the atmosphere, oceans, air, water and biodiversity, which are supposedly available to all but can be overexploited privately at high social cost. In strict <small>esg</small> terms, the aim is not altruistic. It is rather a way of assessing the regulatory or reputational risks that arise from “negative externalities”. A company may also be expected to gauge how seriously at risk it is from climate-change related events, such as extreme weather. </p><p class="article__body-text">The measurements themselves, provided they are standardised and trustworthy, may be useful to everyone. Measuring carbon emissions is critical for tackling climate change, either as a basis for carbon taxes, or for regulatory efforts to rein in emissions, or for giving investors the opportunity to create a “shadow carbon price”, in which high emitters are penalised by the markets. Better data make it clearer who is genuinely cutting emissions and who is not. </p><h2>Measure for measure</h2><p class="article__body-text">The measurements are not easy, though. Companies may report greenhouse-gas emissions in their annual and sustainability reports, as well as to non-financial standard-setters such as the Global Reporting Initiative (<small>gri</small>), a standards group. But as Eelco van der Enden, <small>gri</small>’s boss, sardonically points out: “What gets measured gets managed. But what gets measured also gets manipulated.” That makes it a continuous challenge to improve data quality. </p><p class="article__body-text">The most straightforward emissions are those from a company’s day-to-day operations, called scope one, and those from its energy suppliers, such as electricity companies (scope two). Yet even among listed firms, these are not widely available. The research arm of <small>msci</small>, an index provider, says that of almost 10,000 firms in its world index, less than 40% reported scope-one and -two emissions. The share is likely to be smaller among private and state-owned firms, especially in emerging markets where many emissions are generated.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Even trickier is the measurement of scope-three emissions, which cover an entire supply chain, from extraction of raw materials through suppliers to end users, and account for as much as 90% of emissions in some industries. Supplier data may be hard to find. Consumer data may depend on estimates. Responsibilities may overlap: should an oil company be blamed for emissions when its fuel is burned in a petrol tank, or should the car company—or both? <small>msci</small> says less than a quarter of its constituents report scope-three data, and that the quality is poor. In a recent report, <small>cdp</small>, a data-tracking firm, found that only 55% of European oil and gas companies released scope-three information, even though it accounts for the vast bulk of their carbon footprint. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mandatory regulation of such disclosures, especially those material to a company’s business, should tighten things up. But misgivings about the quality of disclosures have given rise to a new trend. Companies, under pressure from investors and lenders, are increasingly making commitments to science-based and net-zero targets, which aim to keep global warming within the 1.5-2.0°C limit of the 2015 Paris agreement, but do so over medium- and long-term time horizons. At last count, 1,503 firms had science-based targets, and 1,194 had net-zero ones, including parts of Coca-Cola and General Motors.</p><p class="article__body-text">The biggest pressure is on heavy industry, mining, energy and transport firms. Climate Action 100+, a pressure group formed by 700 investment funds, aims to ensure that 166 of the world’s biggest greenhouse-gas emitters align with the Paris targets. It said this year that 69% of them were committed to reach net zero by 2050 or sooner. However, only 17% had set medium-term targets or produced quantified decarbonisation strategies. Almost two-thirds of oil and gas companies are still pursuing projects inconsistent with limiting global warming below 2°C, it noted. </p><p class="article__body-text">Such commitments sound like a burden on companies. Investors appear not to take them seriously because it is rare that a company’s net-zero commitment has an impact on its share price. But they may serve other purposes. Good behaviour, so long as it is in service to a robust business model, may attract a higher calibre of employees and board members, and a good sustainability record may let a company charge more for its products. It may even attract funding. Besides the interest of <small>esg</small> investors in the capital markets, banks are under pressure to target lower emissions in their loan portfolios.</p><p class="article__body-text">Target setting is not without its flaws, however. The danger, as London Business School’s Mr Edmans puts it, is that “You hit the target and miss the point.” He gives an example of an electric-vehicle company with low carbon emissions, but a nasty footprint through lithium-mining.</p><p class="article__body-text">The ideal would be to price negative externalities. Carbon taxes are indeed on the rise. As of the end of 2021, more than a fifth of global emissions were covered by carbon pricing, though at levels too low to cause meaningful changes in behaviour. Amir Amel-Zadeh of Oxford University says that better disclosure should help “internalise the externalities”. The next question is: can the arbiters of disclosure, <small>esg</small> rating agencies, bring enough order to the chaos to influence investment flows?<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
