The incident alerted the country to the power and brazenness of the brothers. In later years they were accused of conspiring with <a href="./why-jacob-zuma-resigned.html">Jacob Zuma</a>, the president from 2009 to 2018, and his cronies in “<a href="./a-decade-of-state-capture-has-damaged-south-africas-institutions.html">state capture</a>”: monumental graft involving public contracts worth at least 49bn rand ($3.2bn) going to Gupta-linked firms. It was said that the cost to the wider economy was many times more; the cost to South Africa’s reputation unquantifiable. The Gupta brothers left the country for Dubai around the time that Mr Zuma stepped down in 2018. Mr Zuma and the Guptas deny doing anything wrong and have described the allegations against them as politically motivated. On June 6th Atul and Rajesh were arrested in the emirate in relation to a test case being pursued by South Africa’s National Prosecuting Authority (<small>NPA</small>). A fight over extradition will follow. The events raise the prospect of another Gupta airline flight, this time less opulent. What would that mean? </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">To understand the implications, recall what the Guptas are alleged to have wrought. The Indian-born brothers, who moved to South Africa in the 1990s, befriended members of the newly ascendant African National Congress, including Mr Zuma. According to several investigations, most recently a judge-led inquiry into state capture, after Mr Zuma became president the Gupta brothers used their relationship to have pliant officials appointed to state-owned enterprises and government departments. These lackeys would steer contracts towards Gupta-linked firms, which would transfer money offshore. Such tactics were involved in the acquisition of a coalmine selling fuel to the state-owned electricity utility at vastly inflated prices; bumper contracts to supply trains to the public freight operator; and a dairy farm in the Free State that milked taxpayers rather than cows. The money for the latter was meant to help poor farmers start an agribusiness. Instead some of the funds were allegedly used to pay for the wedding at Sun City, guests at which were given scarves worth nearly $160,000. </p><p class="article__body-text">In hindsight, the Guptas peaked in October 2015. That month, according to his account, Mcebisi Jonas, the deputy finance minister, was asked by a son of Mr Zuma (and business partner of the Guptas) to visit the Indian family’s compound in Johannesburg. He says he was offered 600m rand to take his boss’s job and “work with them”—and if he had a big enough bag, he could have 600,000 rand in cash that night. Shortly after turning down the offer Mr Jonas described the events to Nhlanhla Nene, the finance minister, who a few days later was fired by Mr Zuma and replaced by an unqualified <small>MP</small>. The rand crashed. Though Mr Zuma got rid of his new appointment, “Nenegate”, and the subsequent report by the public protector about this and other incidents, marked the beginning of the end for “the Zuptas”. In early 2018 Mr Zuma was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa, who promised to clean house. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">If Atul and Rajesh are sent back to South Africa to answer investigators’ many questions, it will be a sign of belated progress. But there remains a long way to go. The arrests were made in response to a “red notice” by Interpol—a request by one member of the organisation (South Africa, in this case) to have suspects arrested pending possible extradition. It probably helped that the United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>), often accused of dragging its heels on money-laundering, was under pressure from authorities in America, which has imposed sanctions on the three brothers and an associate for their “significant corruption network”. The South African government is in talks with officials in the <small>UAE</small> about extraditing them. Any attempt to do so will be fought furiously by the Guptas and their lawyers. And Ajay is not part of the test case. The <small>NPA</small>, eviscerated under Mr Zuma, has been overwhelmed by the work of tackling state capture. </p><p class="article__body-text">Even if the Gupta brothers do end up in South Africa, cases could take years to conclude. Mr Zuma has been able to stall corruption charges first laid against him in 2005; his case may, or may not, conclude this year. Still, the news of the arrest offers tentative hope for all those South Africans—the doughty reporters, brave whistleblowers, tireless public lawyers, and active citizens—who fought to free their captured country. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
