They long to fly like them; to see as they do, sharply with a hawk’s eye; and to sing like them, through instruments or with their own duller, heavier bodies. For some, it is not just a matter of strapping on feather wings, caulked with tar or wax, and jumping off a church tower; or of putting on a feather-suit, like Papageno in “The Magic Flute”, and trilling on a pipe. For a handful of men (it seems always to be men), the aim is to become birds, as far as they can.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/of-birds-and-men.mp3" title="Of birds and men"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">In March 2006 the most famous birdman of recent times, Angelo d’Arrigo, fell to his death in Sicily. He was 44, a passenger in a tiny plane that suddenly nosedived at an air show. For him, this was a large and lumbering craft. Normally a hang-glider carried him, floating on currents of air. Thus he had drifted over Everest at nearly 30,000 feet (9,000 metres), and over Aconcagua in the Andes at 9,100 metres, a world record. He also held the record for the longest horizontal free flight, 1,830km (1,140 miles) without landing, relying only on the wind and the rigid wings that replaced his arms.</p><p class="article__body-text">For his stunts over the highest mountains, a friend would give him an aerotow with a microlight to a suitable altitude. Lower down he used a small 5kg motor for take-off and landing, but for nothing else. He kept quiet because he was gliding alongside birds, learning at source how their great migrations were done.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/xmas-edition-images/XMP525.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">His first such journey was in 2001, flying with desert hawks from Senegal to the Mediterranean. In 2003 he made a similar voyage with six endangered western Siberian cranes. The six had been raised in captivity, so he had to show them their migration route from Siberia to the Caspian Sea in Iran, some 5,500km. It took six months. Each evening he would choose their resting place. As they flew through a polar storm the cranes, trusting in his gaze like children, understood that with him they were safe. His last project, almost completed when he died, was to introduce two young condors to the Andes by soaring with them among the peaks.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">He had raised both the condors and the cranes from the egg. While they were still in the shell he made bird-sounds to them and played them the noise of the hang-glider motor, so they would think it natural. When the condors, Inca and Maya, were hatched, he put a black mask over his shaggy hair to commune with them. When they fledged he put on his hang-glider wings, painted black and white like their own, so that he could mantle them like a parent as he fed them. When they were ready to fly he took them up on Mount Etna and taught them with his own crouching, running and jumping-off. Eventually the three soared together. He called his project “Metamorphosis”: man into bird.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>The nightingale is the harbinger of summer, longing and love</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">His hang-gliders were based mostly on Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches in 1505 for his <em>uccello</em>, or great bird. Leonardo had used wood, leather, rope and canvas, dooming it with too much weight, but d’Arrigo could use aluminium tubes and polyester to create, as closely as possible, the wings of a bird. The hang-glider wings he settled on ended in a single upturned blade, as close to a condor as he could get. In these, as he glided over Aconcagua, he felt he had become the bird.</p><p class="article__body-text">His aim was neither fame nor world records. It was simply to “ride the waves of the sky and the wind”, utterly free and as birds did, by instinct. His desire to soar was like a fever. Plane-speed was purely mechanical; aviators had lost their link to nature. That was why he had to learn the secrets of lower-speed flight by merging with birds. He flew, like a great pianist playing, with his eyes closed. And then he was truly alive.</p><p class="article__body-text">Great raptors fascinate humans not only for the way they fly but the way they see. Hawks spy from a great height, hover, then “stoop”: plummeting on the slightest sign of life. All the stranger, then, that the man who most closely became a hawk in recent decades was a mild, pullover-wearing, short-sighted chap who lived most of his life in Chelmsford, in Essex. As he pursued the peregrine, which came to obsess him, J.A. Baker had only foot and bicycle for trans port. Yet in winter, when peregrines came to Essex, he was out in all weathers, bumping frantically along the lanes, running across fields, crawling through cover, to enter the hawk’s world. As he wrote in “The Peregrine” (1967), “The eye becomes insatiable for hawks.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Soon, indeed, his way of looking and the hawk’s became the same. He could view the land as if from a height, flowing out “in deltas of piercing colour”. Stepping out each morning, always in the same clothes (for so was the hawk), he would know “the way of the wind and the weight of the air”. He shared the fear and exaltation of the bird, and its boredom as it waited for prey to stir. In snow, he shared its solitariness.</p><p class="article__body-text">His view of himself, too, was now the peregrine’s: a hostile human shape, stumbling, unpredictable, with trembling white hands. And his idea of time was the hawk’s, “a clock of blood, and as you hunt…it contracts inward, like a tightening spring”.</p><p class="article__body-text">The hawk came to know him. But it would not share its skill. This he had to sense vicariously, rejoicing in its clever feints before its prey and its conjuring of rising flocks of panicking birds; picking out the laggards, as the hawk did; marvelling at how it could flick a fieldfare from its perch, “as lightly as the wind seizing a leaf”, or strike a death blow so quickly that he missed it, diving “as if hurled from the sky”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Hawklike, he also sought out the kills. He admired the beautiful butchery and noted, from the warmth and wetness of the blood, how fresh the prey was. A kill of a black-headed gull seemed so fresh and sweet to him, “like a mash of raw beef and pineapple”, that he could have eaten it himself. As he crouched over the bodies he became a mantling hawk, watching for men.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/xmas-edition-images/XMP526.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">He was no longer, at such times, a man himself. Finding a hawk’s knobbly claw-prints in the snow, he rested his own hand in them, a fellow being and companion. Their bond was indefinable and impalpable, but it was there: “the strange bondage of the eyes”. He would shut his own and sink “into the skin and blood and bones of the hawk”. After seeing the world through those great brown targeting eyes, he dreaded being “inglorious again”. But all too soon it was back to 20 Finchley Avenue, his wife Doreen, and tea.</p><p class="article__body-text">The aerial masters screech, bicker and cry; the most celebrated bird-musician, however, sings out of deep cover, a small dull lark obscured by night. That secrecy adds to the age-old preciousness of its song. Sam Lee, a London-born folk-singer and conservationist, knows where they are because for several years he has entered their world and sung with them.</p><p class="article__body-text">The bond was instant. When he first heard one sing, it was “an otherworldly baptism”; in 2014 he became a collaborator. He sang then for a radio broadcast from the garden of Beatrice Harrison, a cellist who, 90 years before, had famously played as a nightingale sang. Sam’s instrument was his voice, so he sang “The Tan Yard Side”. As a nightingale joined him, he felt they were in a wild and ancient conversation.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">From that point, as he writes in “The Nightingale” (2020), he has come closer and closer to the birds. For six weeks a year, in April and May when the nightingale sings most ardently, Sam is “almost feral”. He is nightingale-invisible in the woods, going barefoot and wearing a woollen jacket that makes no sound in the rain. No phone, no torch; he relies on instinct, and finds his peripheral vision sharpened (as Baker did) to a full circle of awareness, the view of the watching bird. Every so often he falls into stillness, to take in the feel of the woods. The best cover he has found, the nightingale’s own choice, is a shell of thorns.</p><p class="article__body-text">That song surprised him on first hearing. The nightingale is traditionally the harbinger of summer, longing and love. But what Sam heard was “mercurial, spacious, gymnastic, brazen, exuberant…flamboyant, histrionic and wounded”, all from a creature that sang, like him, unaccompanied and alone. Nightingales helped him with his improvisation. They also helped him understand himself, because—like all great performers—they seemed to expose and amplify what ever mood he had brought with him into the woods.</p><p class="article__body-text">Gradually, instead of singing his human songs to them, he began to lure them with sounds they would understand. He approaches them now with harmonic whistles in the same pitch as the birds’ song, and they respond to him as to one of them. The tonality still strikes him as acerbic and strange, but each time it becomes beauty, and then he wants nothing else.</p><p class="article__body-text">With the nightingales, singing or listening, he feels he is “spinning myself farther back into the web of nature”. Thoughts are washed away and the bird “rinses right through you”; there is a sense of dissolving, even flying. Like d’Arrigo, like Baker, he loses for a time the heaviness of human existence. Unlike them, he has also discovered that men (and women) may come closest to birds when they are simply whistling. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PHOTOGRAPHS: M.
