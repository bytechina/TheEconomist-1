To test that bold assertion, launch a streaming service and cue up the album “Voodoo”, by D’Angelo, released in 2000. Once the opening track, “Playa Playa”, reaches its groove, around 90 seconds in, try tapping your fingers against your thigh in time with the bassline.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/j-dilla-reinvented-rhythm-says-dan-charnas-in-dilla-time.mp3" title="J Dilla “reinvented rhythm”, says Dan Charnas in “Dilla Time”"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">You’ll find it almost impossible. Pino Palladino, the bassist, thought that the rhythm sounded “wobbly”. The notes fall in the wrong places—on the wrong beat in the bar or moved slightly in time, just before or behind where the ear expects them to be. The effect is to make the music feel woozy and destabilising.</p><p class="article__body-text">What you’re hearing is “Dilla time”, which, Dan Charnas argues fairly convincingly, reshaped the sound of hip-hop—and thus the sound of pop—its wrongness adding a human element to music that had previously been focused on mechanical precision. Mr Charnas’s book attempts to be more than a biography: interpolated between its chapters on Dilla’s life are others that explain how musical time works, and how Dilla interpreted it in the tracks he made for himself and as a producer and inspiration for others.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">“Dilla Time” is at its best when the two strands come together; in the section on his work with the Soulquarians collective (who were behind “Voodoo”), the air of artists discovering new possibilities within music is palpable. Such passages do what good music books should: send you back to the source material. As “Dilla Time” launches the reader on a flight through Dilla’s confusing discography—it ought to have included a playlist—the breadth of his imagination becomes obvious.</p><p class="article__body-text">The strictly biographical parts are more pedestrian. Mr Charnas steers clear of the kind of portentous foreshadowing that blights some biographies; but the occasional insight is swamped by the sense that he has found out more about Dilla than anyone else before him, and, perhaps understandably, wants the reader to know it.</p><p class="article__body-text">No detail is too small, no fact too tangential. That is especially a problem in the part covering the period after Dilla’s death in February 2006, at the age of 32. Mr Charnas needed to examine the way a Dilla industry subsequently sprang up, but the book becomes a wearying list of events, posthumous albums and arguments between Dilla’s estate and his family. The magic was in the music.</p><p class="article__body-text">Nevertheless “Dilla Time” is an important piece of music writing, affording its African-American subject the respect that the rock establishment has long accorded its white heroes. Dilla’s work emerges as a mix of intellect and instinct. He experienced music in a different way from his peers, and knew how to bring life to a sound that no one else heard. Best of all is to read about an album such as “Donuts”—just a collection of Dilla’s looped beats, but made with dizzying imagination and dexterity—and be able to understand why it sounds the way it does. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline "Hearing lessons"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=J%20Dilla%20%E2%80%9Creinvented%20rhythm%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20Dan%20Charnas%20in%20%E2%80%9CDilla%20Time%E2%80%9D&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-22&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F8ah24v7r48q06sdoq96aqt2fk3s7a0s8&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
