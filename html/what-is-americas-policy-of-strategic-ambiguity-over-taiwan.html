Asked at a press conference in Tokyo on May 23rd whether America would get involved militarily <a href="./how-to-deter-china-from-attacking-taiwan.html">if China attacked Taiwan</a>, President Joe Biden replied: “Yes…That’s the commitment we made.” But American officials were quick to explain that this apparently unambiguous commitment to Taiwan’s defence was nothing of the sort: it constituted no departure at all from America’s long-standing Taiwan policy, which is often summed up as one of leaving its options open, dubbed “strategic ambiguity”. But exactly what does that mean? And why is the ambiguity required?</p><p class="article__body-text">A few days earlier, Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden’s national security adviser, had reiterated America’s Taiwan policy, which had not changed, he said. He made it sound like a complex mathematical formula, citing: “the <a href="./what-is-the-one-china-policy.html">one-China policy</a>”; “the three joint communiqués”; “the Taiwan Relations Act”; and “the six assurances”. So there is no shortage of documentation behind the policy. The problem is that it is riddled with inconsistencies.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The one-China policy and the three joint communiqués refer to agreements reached by China and America between 1972 and 1982. In 1972 Richard Nixon visited China, ending the two countries’ long estrangement, during which America recognised the government in Taipei as the legitimate ruler of all of China (as the “Republic of China”). In the first “Shanghai communiqué”, during Nixon’s visit, America agreed “that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China”. This was not true, but acknowledged that each government claimed sovereignty over territory controlled by the other. So it was seen as an acceptable fiction. It was maintained after January 1st 1979, when America switched its diplomatic recognition to the government in Beijing. </p><p class="article__body-text">To do that, America had to abrogate its mutual-defence treaty with Taiwan, signed in 1954. Yet China had not then, and has never since, renounced what it says is its right to use force to “reunify” Taiwan in some circumstances. Congress stepped into the breach, passing in 1979 the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). This did not commit America explicitly to come to Taiwan’s defence. But it did promise to provide Taiwan with “arms of a defensive character” and to “consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means…a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific Area and of grave concern to the United States”.</p><p class="article__body-text">China was incensed at what it saw as continued American meddling, and kept up the pressure on America to weaken its support of Taiwan, securing a commitment in 1982 that America would gradually reduce its arms sales to Taiwan. The commitment has not been honoured, but to sugar the pill at the time America made “six assurances” to Taiwan, promising, among other things, that it would not set a date for ending arms supplies, and would not repeal the TRA. Though widely known, these assurances were not officially published by the State Department until 2020. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">America’s Taiwan policy has critics from both sides. Some worry it is too much of a commitment: that it risks drawing America into an unnecessary war with China to defend Taiwan, and allows Taiwan to get away with doing too little for its own defence. Others argue the commitment is too little: that the vagueness may encourage Chinese adventurism. </p><p class="article__body-text">Supporters of strategic ambiguity argue that, for the four decades since America switched diplomatic relations from Taiwan to China, it has worked. It has provided enough reassurance that America would not let an invasion go unimpeded to deter China, but not so much as to embolden those in Taiwan who favour a formal declaration of independence—something China has always warned would mean war. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden became a senator less than a year after Nixon’s visit to China, so he is presumably well aware of the nuances of America’s Taiwan policy. Yet his apparent lack of ambiguity in Tokyo was the third time since August that he has said something similar, with his henchmen on each occasion denying that anything has changed. Two possible explanations offer themselves: that it is a repeated gaffe; or that he has concluded nothing is to be lost by going further in America’s commitment to Taiwan than the official policy, and that, relations with China being so poor at the moment anyway, this is not going to worsen them markedly, especially when accompanied by immediate reassurance that nothing has changed. But the gap between presidential statements and official policy is giving rise to a new form of ambiguity—strategic perhaps; or maybe simply incoherent.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./does-america-have-troops-in-taiwan.html">Does America have troops in Taiwan?</a><br/><a href="./what-is-taiwans-porcupine-defence-strategy.html">What is Taiwan’s porcupine defence strategy?</a><br/><a href="./why-taiwan-is-not-recognised-on-the-international-stage.html">Why Taiwan is not recognised on the international stage</a></p></div></body></html>
