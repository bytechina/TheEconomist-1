Nearly 500,000 of the 10m cases of tuberculosis in 2019, for example, were drug-resistant. Good news, however, emerged on October 19th, when the Comprehensive Resistance Prediction for Tuberculosis International Consortium (<small>CR</small>y<small>PTIC,</small> for short), an international collaboration that has been searching for quick ways to diagnose resistant strains, published the fruits of its labours. The result of the consortium’s analysis of more than 15,000 samples from patients in 27 countries is a way of detecting any and every resistance-inducing mutation in a particular bacterium’s genome.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">At the moment, determining whether the strain causing a particular case of <small>TB</small> is resistant to a particular drug is tricky. One common approach, now more than 100 years old, involves culturing microbes from a sputum sample in a Petri dish until they are abundant enough to form a visible plaque. A drug or drugs can then be sprinkled on this plaque, to see if the germs stop proliferating. But <em>M. tuberculosis</em> reproduces notoriously slowly in laboratory conditions. It takes two to six weeks to grow enough of it for a test, and up to three further weeks for that test to yield a result. Even then, the result may not be easy to interpret. The answer as to whether the drugs have worked is literally in the eye of the beholder—and different pairs of eyes often behold different answers.</p><p class="article__body-text">About 15 years ago, however, researchers using new gene-sequencing technology began identifying specific, resistance-conferring mutations in <em>M. tuberculosis</em>’s genome. That led to the employment of a test called the polymerase chain reaction (<small>PCR</small>) to search samples for these mutations. <small>PCR</small> testing requires only a small amount of the bacterium, so it can be completed within hours. <small>PCR</small> tests are therefore now widely used to identify resistance-conferring mutations to rifampicin, one of the most effective anti-<small>TB</small> drugs.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>CR</small>y<small>PTIC</small>’s researchers proposed extending <small>PCR</small> testing’s scope by identifying all possible combinations of mutations that confer resistance to any combination of drugs, and also by assessing mutation-related levels of resistance to different doses of a drug. Instead of Petri dishes, participating laboratories used culture plates with 96 wells to grow the bacteria. The wells contained various amounts of 13 tuberculosis drugs. After the drugs had had time to act, the plates were photographed. The images were then entered into a database, for examination.</p><p class="article__body-text">That part of the process, though, still required human eyeballs. These were supplied by 9,000 crowdsourced “citizen scientists”, with each plate being examined independently by about 15 such volunteers. Comparing the results of these examinations with full-genome sequences of each sample let <small>CR</small>y<small>PTIC</small>’s researchers discover what combinations of gene changes were correlated with which forms of drug resistance.</p><h2>Decryption</h2><p class="article__body-text">Some of their findings are surprising. It turns out, for example, that a resistance-conferring mutation may co-exist with another that cancels that effect out. But they are confident they have identified almost all combinations of mutations that matter. The resulting catalogue will, they hope, be used to design better <small>PCR</small> tests. And, as rapid whole-genome sequencing becomes increasingly available, it will also identify the combination of drugs most likely to cure a particular patient.</p><p class="article__body-text">This will enable personalised treatment for tuberculosis. It will also make treatment less gruelling. The current standard is a cocktail of several antibiotics that must be taken for at least six months—a regimen with harsh side-effects. Getting the prescription wrong and having to try another combination of drugs is hard on patients. Many drop out of treatment.</p><p class="article__body-text">On top of all that, the <small>CR</small>y<small>PTIC</small> approach could serve as a template for investigations of drug resistance in other pathogens. This could help head off the spread of such resistance, which has accompanied the promiscuous and sloppy use of antibiotics around the world. If precise diagnosis can stop this spread in its tracks, <small>CR</small>y<small>PTIC</small>’s results will have implications for public as well as personal health. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on October 19th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "Making resistance useless"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Most%20resistance-causing%20mutations%20in%20TB%20have%20now%20been%20identified&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-19&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F3dv7i17m94p94kc6hssd1a6jkb92514j&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
