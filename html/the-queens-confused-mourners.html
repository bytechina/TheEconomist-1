The news channels had abandoned normal programming, presenters had changed into black ties and the crowd was waiting for some kind of sign that would make <a href="./elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown.html">the news official</a>. As Penny looked up, a limp Union Jack was being lowered on the flagpole. Everyone fell silent. </p><p class="article__body-text">Two men in uniform were coming out of the palace holding a notice. People ran towards the railings, but Penny kept looking at the flag, which was rippling with an uncanny, underwater slowness. Evening clouds ran behind it like lilac cannon smoke. Then the heavens obliged the occasion with a sentimental show: a late, watery shaft of sun broke dramatically across the palace. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Penny fought her way to the front and read the small printed notice that had been chained to the railings, informing people that Elizabeth II had died. More people arrived following the official announcement, but the feeling of waiting for a cue lingered. Scattered bursts of applause would erupt, then people would look around to see what was being applauded. Was something happening? There were infrequent, sparse shouts of “hip hip, hooray”. It started raining. </p><p class="article__body-text">Few wore black, <a href="./how-britain-has-changed-since-elizabeth-ii-was-crowned-in-1953.html">unlike the mourners of 70 years ago, when the Queen’s father, George VI, died</a>. They were more or less a cross-section of London: every class and ethnicity, young and old, tourists from around the world. Some people’s eyes were pink from crying, while others brought beer.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“That is pure, pure opportunism,” said one member of the crowd at Buckingham Palace</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Many struggled to explain why they were there. One woman told me she was “by no stretch of the imagination a monarchist” but had felt it was appropriate to go to the palace. I heard this qualification a lot. Other people told me they were monarchists, using the surprised tone of someone saying it out loud for the first time. </p><p class="article__body-text">You could use a crowd this diverse to tell any story you liked, and journalists and photographers prowled in search of the right kind of mourner. Alongside the legacy media, Tik-Tokkers with ring-lights stood under plastic umbrellas conducting interviews. I watched a couple walk past them shaking their heads. “That is pure, <i>pure</i> opportunism,” said one to the other.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet for all the circus, there was something anticlimactic about being at the gates of Buckingham Palace <a href="./the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era.html">the night that history was made there</a>. It was as if people needed a trumpet blast, a cannon shot, something to give them a sense that this was An Occasion.</p><p class="article__body-text">Few of us realised at the time that we ourselves were providing that ceremonial function for the rest of the world. We were the massed mourners, the visual evidence of a spontaneous outpouring of love that could be broadcast around the globe as proof that something was happening. We were performing the only constant role in the centuries-long theatre of Britain’s monarchy: the crowd. </p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2496/1664/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-02.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1664" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-02.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-02.jpg" width="2496"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2496/1664/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-03.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1664" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-03.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-03.jpg" width="2496"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2455/1636/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-04.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1636" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-04.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-04.jpg" width="2455"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2058/1372/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-05.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1372" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-05.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-05.jpg" width="2058"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-06.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-06.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-06.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2053/1369/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-07.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1369" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-07.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-07.jpg" width="2053"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">At the palace gates the rain was falling hard. Every so often a few enthusiasts would strike up a little bravely with “God Save the Queen” – or was it the King, now? The last word of the national anthem suddenly became the focus of everyone’s confused feelings about the transition from the old and familiar to the strange and new. Some people sang “God Save the Qu-ing”. I heard a passing teenager explain to a friend her reluctance to use the word “King” in the song: “it sounds too patriotic.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span>t was warm and wet as I emerged from the tube station the next day to see a 96-gun salute in Hyde Park. I wasn’t sure how you were supposed to observe a 96-gun salute or which bit of the park it would be in; everyone was asking everyone else where they were going.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">I got chatting to a man called Martin Dove, who had been on the phone to his sister, watching rolling news coverage with the sound down, when the Queen’s death was announced. The camera was trained on the scene at the palace gates, then suddenly panned to show the flag being lowered. He said it made him go cold even to talk about it. </p><p class="article__body-text">When we got to the park a tiny, far-off voice shouted “fire!”. The first gun sounded like the crack of a bomb, followed by a roll of thunder fading away into the distance. The crowd around me giggled at that shot, then fell silent at the second. After that, no one spoke. We stood motionless for 15 minutes, our eardrums tingling. As soon as the last gun sounded, the crowd moved with one mind, back towards the palace. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>We were performing the only constant role in the centuries-long theatre of Britain’s monarchy: the crowd</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Martin Amis, a British novelist, once wrote that monarchy is a holiday from rationality, and there was almost a festive feeling in the air that day. Two women with corgis dressed in Union Jack neckerchiefs told me they had brought their dogs to cheer people up, but I wasn’t sure how much cheering up was needed. There were none of the crumpled faces and sobs so ubiquitous after Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997. The Queen’s initial slowness to respond to public grief for her former daughter-in-law was a rare moment when she seemed to misjudge the public mood (a misstep that some people briefly thought might even topple the monarchy).</p><p class="article__body-text">The atmosphere this time, if anything, was quite fun. We flowed past the spreading tributes of cellophane-wrapped flowers in Green Park towards a set of metal barricades on the road leading to Buckingham Palace. People were staring expectantly at the empty street. I asked what was about to happen. “I don’t know,” said one woman. “I just go with the crowd.” Men in fluorescent-green vests patrolled the barricades and stopped people from crossing the road.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-08.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-08.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-08.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2039/1359/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-09.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1359" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-09.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-09.jpg" width="2039"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2000/1352/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-10.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1352" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-10.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-10.jpg" width="2000"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-11.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-11.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-11.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-12.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-12.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-12.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1991/1328/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-13.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1328" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-13.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-13.jpg" width="1991"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">For about 15 minutes around 200 of us were kettled, to everyone’s irritation. A troop of horses went past. No one could move. More people were pushing to the front of the barricade.</p><p class="article__body-text">“Please move back!” shouted a police officer. </p><p class="article__body-text">“Into what?” returned an angry voice from the back of the crowd. </p><p class="article__body-text">Then, very distinctly, a little tremor went through the group. Across the road, onlookers were lifting their phones up. People on our side started to lift them up too. At first it looked like they were filming each other. Then the hoisted phones turned like sunflowers towards something that was coming down the road. “He’s not <i>in </i>the palace,” explained a man to his child. “He’s coming now in a car.” A vigorous cheer was moving down the line. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">And suddenly there he was: taller than I expected, sitting stiffly in a black Rolls-Royce with his wife. He was out of sight within a few seconds. </p><p class="article__body-text">“The King!” shouted someone. </p><p class="article__body-text">We all knew, of course, that we had a king now. The furniture of public life, most of it unnoticed for years, is being busily rearranged. There will be <a href="./drama-queen-her-majesty-on-screen-from-the-simpsons-to-the-crown.html">new money, new stamps</a>, new post boxes. For 70 years Britain’s most senior lawyers have written the letters “<small>QC</small>” after their names to signify they had achieved the status of “Queen’s Counsel”. Now they are <small>KC</small>s, practising His Majesty’s laws. Overnight, Britain’s constitutional embellishments have swapped gender. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>The hoisted phones turned like sunflowers towards something that was coming down the road</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">But it is jarring. King Charles III’s presence in the crowd later that day went some way towards embedding the change in his status (it wasn’t until I got home that I saw the images of him going around shaking people’s hands). Though they’d come to mourn the Queen, most people I spoke to seemed to feel warmly towards the man who had just lost his mother. Chichi, a 21-year-old pharmacist – “I wouldn’t call myself a monarchist, but…” – said she’d felt supportive of Prince Charles – King Charles – ever since watching “The Crown” on Netflix.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">T</span>he Queen’s popularity in Britain almost defies understanding. Earlier this year she had an approval rating of an estimated 75% (prime ministers can only dream of getting such a big thumbs up). This wasn’t intense, passionate support, but it was extremely broad.</p><p class="article__body-text">And so, once the working week was over, people came from across the country to join the public rituals. On Saturday the crowds at Buckingham Palace were so thick that it was impossible to move. You couldn’t get a phone signal from Hyde Park Corner to Pall Mall. It took 40 minutes to walk 100 metres. In front of me, a young child wailed in protest at the slow progress. “Disrespectful little girl!” hissed her mother. </p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-14.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-14.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-14.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-15.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-15.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-15.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1841/1227/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-16.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1227" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-16.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-16.jpg" width="1841"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-17.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-17.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-17.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2080/1387/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-18.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1387" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-18.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-18.jpg" width="2080"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/2040/1360/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-19.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1360" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-19.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220912_QUEEN-19.jpg" width="2040"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Large groups, moving in different directions down tight avenues, would come to a terse standstill when they met. People would push from the back towards the front and both sides, and people on the other side would do the same. Sometimes this would go on for 20 minutes, with no one moving. It was embarrassing to be part of such an obvious failure of collective spatial reasoning.</p><p class="article__body-text">Though the crowd control still wasn’t very effective, the authorities were now giving mourners more of a focus. On Saturday Prince Charles was officially proclaimed King at a ceremony in St James’s Palace, less than a mile from Buckingham Palace. From my vantage position, I saw a troop of mounted soldiers in dress uniform: red coats, silver armour and tasselled helmets, with sabres over their shoulders. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Two women with corgis dressed in Union Jack neckerchiefs told me they had brought their dogs to cheer people up</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">The crowd by the barriers was 15-people deep and growing. There were bystanders on lampposts, others balancing on railings. A woman was sitting on her teenage son’s shoulders. It felt like a medieval period drama, except for the smartphones. At one point people close to me were striving to outdo each other with the intensity of their shouting: “God save the King! God save the King!” The uncertainty of Thursday night seemed distant.</p><p class="article__body-text">Then a huge cheer erupted down at the Buckingham Palace end of the Mall. It got louder as something got nearer that may or may not have carried the King. Eventually I fought my way forward and was able to see what was on the road: a utility vehicle towing rubbish, with a man standing on the trailer behind it filming the crowds on his phone. They cheered him all the way to Trafalgar Square. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>John Phipps</b> is a contributing writer for <i>1843 magazine</i>.
