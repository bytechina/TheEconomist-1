After that defeat duly transpired Mr Trump’s attorney-general, William Barr, informed him that his claim to be the victim of electoral fraud was “bullshit” and “nonsense”. Snippets of interviews given to the committee by both men were played in the public hearing—as was footage of an interview given by a tense-looking Ivanka Trump, in which she acknowledged that she had straightforwardly accepted Mr Barr’s view.</p><p class="article__body-text">Why, if the fact that the president was lying was accepted within the administration, did almost none of its members speak out? Another snippet of testimony, from Jared Kushner, offered a clue. In response to questioning from Ms Cheney, Mr Kushner, the president’s consigliere and, as Ms Trump’s husband, his son-in-law, said that he had indeed been aware that the team of the White House counsel was threatening to quit over Mr Trump’s allegations, but that he considered such threats to be “whining”. This was an administration without basic principle.</p><p class="article__body-text">It was immediately clear that Mr Trump’s lies inspired the Capitol riot, which claimed up to nine lives either on the day or subsequently from injuries and police suicides. The former president had invited the mob to a rally in Washington, <small>dc</small>; and there instructed them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell”. When asked later why they were inside the building, many of the insurrectionists explained that Mr Trump had sent them. Yet the committee appears to have concluded that Mr Trump was even more complicit in the violence than that would suggest.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">If he did not plan it he encouraged it, the hearing suggested. Mr Trump had pandered to the Proud Boys and Oath-Keepers, the far-right militia groups that led the assault. A member of the Proud Boys told the committee that its recruitment increased threefold after Mr Trump, before the election, had instructed its members to “stand by”. And senior figures in Trumpworld appear to have been forewarned of the militamen’s violent intent. “All hell will break loose tomorrow,” Steve Bannon, Mr Trump’s former chief strategist, told his podcast listeners on January 5th.</p><p class="article__body-text">When it did, Mr Trump sat back and watched it happen. “Not only did President Trump refuse to tell the mob to leave the Capitol, he placed no call to any element of the US government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,” said Ms Cheney, in a powerful opening speech. “He did not call his secretary of defence on January 6th. He did not talk to his attorney-general. He did not talk to the Department of Homeland Security. President Trump gave no order to deploy the National Guard that day, and he made no effort to work with the Department of Justice to co-ordinate and deploy law-enforcement assets.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Trump’s vice-president, Mike Pence, did do those things, Ms Cheney added—even as the mob was threatening to hang him for standing against Mr Trump’s attempted heist. When Mr Trump, watching the riot on television, was informed of that, he allegedly responded: “Maybe our supporters have the right idea.” Mike Pence “deserves” it.</p><p class="article__body-text">As was typical for the hearing, that added a compelling detail to the contemporaneous reporting of the riot without revising it. Much the same was true of the hearing’s treatment of the insurrection itself. It offered no significant new analysis of January 6th. Yet it powerfully recreated that day’s horrors in the form of new video footage and live testimony from two people caught up in the riot: a British documentary film-maker called Nick Quested, and Caroline Edwards, a Capitol Hill police officer who was knocked senseless by the mob. “It was a war scene,” she said.</p><p class="article__body-text">It is almost beyond belief that Americans are not united in revulsion towards that abomination. Yet surveys suggest most Republicans persist in saying both that the election was stolen from Mr Trump, and that he bears no responsibility for the riot. There is little chance that the January 6th committee will convince many of them otherwise, now or after the half-dozen further hearings it is planning this month (the next, due on June 13th, will describe Mr Trump’s efforts to change the election results in the key states that he lost). Fox News did not even broadcast the hearing. The Republican leadership has dismissed it as a partisan witch-hunt. The best hope for the Democrats who dominate the committee is to rally their own voters against that cynicism in November’s mid-terms.</p><p class="article__body-text">It would be wrong, though, to judge the committee’s work mainly by its political fallout. Its task was to provide a full and sober record of the insurrection and, by inference, of the ongoing threat to democracy presented by the Trump right. Whether voters choose to take note is not in the committee’s power to determine. But it seems certain that future generations will, and that, Ms Cheney noted, is something that should worry her own party: “Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible: there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain.”<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
