violence and political instability gave me the queasy sensation of wading into one last foreign-reporting assignment, except now it was my own country and there was no prospect of eventual escape. I’d lived and studied in Washington years earlier, but had never seen it like this, militarised and frayed. The windows of banks and shops had been boarded over with plywood to discourage looters. The nerdy throngs of bustling bureaucrats had scattered off into remote workplaces, replaced by armoured vehicles and clusters of troops.</p><p class="article__body-text">Looking back to that summer, it’s plain that we were already moving towards the events of January 6th 2021; that every shocking incident broke a little more ground towards the eventual climax. As a new exhibition of photographs, “America in Crisis” at the Saatchi Gallery in London, shows, the current troubles have deep roots.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>How could a child fall out of the window and the world not move?</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">The days were long and stultifying in the summer of 2020. Trash skittered along empty streets; a protest march poured around a corner; a <small>VIP</small> convoy skidded raucously over the river. As the afternoons stretched to dusk a quiet, silvery unease would spread over the city, stealthy as floodwater. Sirens whined in the night and helicopters chopped low over the rooftops, slamming us awake. Beatings and tear gas spilled through darkened parks as crowds rushed against monuments to dead men who trafficked in racial oppression. My family filtered around these scenes, preoccupied with the complicated personal tasks of moving country during a pandemic. At night, as the crowds fought over history and power, we locked ourselves in our temporary apartment and tried to sleep.</p><p class="article__body-text">We picnicked with friends in a park on Capitol Hill one day, lounging on blankets while the kids raced through the grass. One friend was a photographer; he’d been going out at night, taking pictures of the clashes over the statues. “There’s one here, in this park,” his wife said suddenly. “It’s really bad.”</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/843/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="843" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_002.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_002.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_003.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_003.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/845/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_004.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="845" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_004.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_004.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_005.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_005.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_005.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/859/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_006.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="859" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_006.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_006.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Fight for your rights</b> The Statue of Liberty, Bruce Davidson, 1969 (opening image). <i>From top to bottom</i>: A family barbecue, Elliott Erwitt, 1959.

It was the Emancipation Memorial: Abraham Lincoln towered benevolently over a kneeling black man, Lincoln’s hand hovering over the figure’s stooped shoulders, as if bestowing a priestly blessing. Frederick Douglass had inaugurated this statue but also wrote a scathing complaint about the image of a black man “couchant on his knees like a four-footed animal”. Now the statue was roped off. A lone demonstrator with a bullhorn wailed unheeded condemnations into a cheerful sea of picnickers.</p><p class="article__body-text">“I can’t believe anyone cares about these monuments,” I said. “Just tear them all down. Put them in a museum or something. Who cares?” I was thinking of a garden on the riverbend in Moscow where the broken chunks of Soviet statuary lie scattered among fruit trees. Do something like that.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">“Totally,” said the photographer, and spread his hands in disbelief. “Who fucking cares?”</p><p class="article__body-text">And for a moment it felt sane.

A dull thud sounded below and the screaming continued, pouring in the window and through the wall from the next apartment.</p><p class="article__body-text">“It’s here.” I turned and ran, unthinking, out to the hall.</p><p class="article__body-text">A man marched up and down the corridor, phone to ear, hair frizzed out from his head. “My daughter fell out the window,” he told me woodenly.

Thin red light moved over the bricks of the buildings and stretched the shadows like they were elastic. Paramedics loaded the stretcher into the ambulance, a child’s form strapped into place. A woman, the mother, climbed in behind the stretcher.</p><p class="article__body-text">I took the lift down in my pyjamas. “She’s OK,” the woman behind the front desk told me, and I clapped a hand to my chest like my heart might tumble out. “She was breathing. The paramedics said she’d be OK.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The doorwoman led me out into the courtyard to show me how lucky the girl had been. The child had landed on a small wooden deck, missing the concrete. Wood, the doorwoman said, was softer. Three tall storeys up the screen had been ripped clean off the frame and hung in a useless tatter from one corner. “She was leaning back,” the doorwoman said. “Her mother was working on the computer and the girl was sitting on the windowsill and she leaned back. The whole screen broke and she just fell out.”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Our inchoate fear was suddenly manifest</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Upstairs I sat shipwrecked in the dark. The windows and balconies, the falling – this had been a specific fear of mine as a mother. And now it was here. When these lines abruptly blur it’s hard to settle down. You start to wonder, if it can go that far, what else can happen?</p><p class="article__body-text">I texted a friend about the girl and the window and the screen hanging by threads. Her answer – <i>Is just anything randomly happening now??</i> – displayed a grasp of what I also felt: order and boundaries had become dangerously scrambled. Then my friend told me that her mother had warned her of a severe planetary misalignment. <i>How long will it last</i>, I asked. Through the week at least, my friend replied. <i>Maybe we should listen to her, I don’t know, she never gets into things like this.</i></p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This struck me as sensible, a reassertion of rules, even though I knew that neither my friend and I, nor even, possibly, her mother believed the planets were to blame. People who have no use for religion or superstition or politics never understand this: these things don’t have to be true, they just have to create the illusion of predictability.</p><p class="article__body-text">We crave explanations and limits; cause and effect. My friend and I texted back and forth, telling each other how awful it was, agreeing that in the morning we’d tell our children the story as a warning. Whatever else happened – and anything might – we’d turn this to our advantage. We could now prevent our own kids from tumbling out of the window. It looked like a perilous rupture, a hole in the membrane of daily life, but we could still knit it shut: we could remake it into a safeguard.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>The foot soldiers of the Capitol attack are the new terrorists of the respectable American imagination</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">“Do you still think it’s going to be alright?” This was another friend.

Well,” I’d correct myself. “I think it’s going to be as much all right as it was before.”</p><p class="article__body-text">“You’re the only one who ever says that,” she said. “But I like to hear it, because I feel like you would know because you’ve seen so many other places.”</p><p class="article__body-text">“Maybe.” And I’d think: maybe not.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_010.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="850" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_010.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_010.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/847/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_011.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="847" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_011.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_011.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1942/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_012.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1942" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_012.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_012.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/857/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_013.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="857" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_013.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_013.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Playing politics</b> <i>From top to bottom</i>: An American family in Riverdale, Charles Harbutt.

I felt unbelievably stupid playing this role: <i>I have returned from scorched places and so I see the truth. Give me your hand; I will read your fate in its creases.</i> I also suspected that she ignored half of what I was saying – that in so far as things had been OK before, they would be OK again.</p><p class="article__body-text">She heard that as a rosy prognostication because, as far as she was concerned, everything had been fine before – not perfect, but on a steady trajectory of improvement. When I pointed out to her that much of the country had never fully recovered from the financial crisis of 2008, she’d reply that the Obama administration had done what it could. When I reminded her of all the country’s other historical ugliness – ethnic cleansing and separatist war, slavery and political murder – she’d agree earnestly, explaining that she was upset precisely because, until Trump, she’d believed that social enlightenment was steadily swelling, albeit broken by occasional hiccups of brutality. Now she wasn’t sure if we were progressing, spinning or sinking.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>The cracks and casual cruelties were in plain sight</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">A highly educated, white-collar professional married to another highly educated, white-collar professional, my friend had started to worry about whether the lack of material challenges faced by her children would impede them from developing “grit”. She is the daughter of immigrants, a woman of enormous compassion and wisdom, one of my favourite people, but our understanding of our shared country had diverged.</p><p class="article__body-text">The repeated conversation frustrated me not so much because we never convinced each other of anything, nor because I felt vaguely that my memories were being riffled, but because my friend truly thought the critical question was whether an era of respectful discourse and nominal progress would return. And I couldn’t see what had been so great about the moment she missed, perhaps because I hadn’t been physically present to get lulled by its comforts. To me, it looked as mythical and exclusionary as the land Trump invoked in the “Make America Great Again” slogan. The implied premise – that all the Trump-era nastiness crashed down on our innocent land like a meteor from the sky – agitated me greatly. I’d spent those years in different places, and from where I’d been, the cracks and casual cruelties were in plain sight. I didn’t know where to begin explaining this, because it hadn’t been any one experience or assignment – it had been all of them.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In the late 1990s I reported from the Texas-Mexico border. Children were not systematically separated from their parents, as far as I know, but migrants were hunted by federal officers, abused by traffickers and left to drown in the currents or succumb to dehydration in the desert. Immigrants crossed the border back then at a higher rate than at any point during Trump’s tenure, but the flow of people was regarded as an ongoing if unpopular reality, not a sudden crisis.</p><p class="article__body-text">I later spent years flying back and forth between the bloodshed of the terror wars after 9/11, and the pleasant detachment of home, where nobody at Starbucks seemed to know, let alone worry, about what we were doing abroad.

When I say this to my newly fretful friends what I mean is: I want to feel what you are feeling, that magnitude of shock and dismay, but it’s not inside me anymore. I’ve already had to bind together too many jarring memories into a concept of an unfinished country that is violent, hopeful, destructive, beautiful, possible and, at root, mine.</p><p class="article__body-text">To pretend that the Trump era was wildly aberrant is to erase all the things that were already happening, to deny who we have been and what we have done. Look at us, who did you think we were? But I find myself falling into tenderness with my friend, too, because her pain and fright are real. I can’t see what she sees but neither of us can say who is right.</p><p class="article__body-text">“I’m scared about the election,” she said. “They have so many guns. What if they go to the polling stations?”</p><p class="article__body-text">“It’s disturbing,” I agreed.</p><p class="article__body-text">“If he loses, do you think he’ll go?”</p><p class="article__body-text">“They’d carry him out if it came to that.”</p><p class="article__body-text">I was listening to a lot of conservative radio in the days before the election; the tone there, too, was apocalyptic. Callers described stocking up on canned goods, hunting for deer and preparing to defend themselves against enraged Democrats, who would surely carry out violent rampages if Trump prevailed. The death of George Floyd had been seized upon by the Democrats as a pretext to riot and loot and destroy America’s great cities, the morning host frequently reminded his listeners, and the media was complicit in covering up the depravity of the mobs. They hate you, he’d say. They hate your way of life. They’re crazy.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>My friends do not want to hear that hanging on the edge of disaster is more or less a national tradition</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">I cast my ballot in a community-centre gym and then posted a picture of my “I Voted” sticker on social media with a note: “…so please stop reminding me.” My feeds had degenerated into a sanctimonious string of earnest patriots, all of whom wanted to remind me that this was the most important election of my life and if I didn’t do my duty we’d soon be living under the boot of fascism. Only when election day had passed did I allow myself to admit that, all day, I’d half-expected a news alert about a polling station getting shot up. But it hadn’t come. The system had held. Even when Trump started hyping his Big Lie, even when he tried to bully Republican officials to help him craft a fraudulent win, the system endured.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">B</span>ut somehow it still wasn’t over. Trump, unwilling to accept his loss, cheered his followers as they went to the Capitol to disrupt the vote certification and, in effect, to violently suppress the people’s voice. The full extent of planning and collaboration remains under investigation, but enough of it happened in plain sight to provide a general idea. The rest of us froze and watched. It was so clean, in a way, such an absolute catharsis of suspicion, to see this fearsome crowd come when Trump called, to hear the slurs and see people beaten with the flag. Our inchoate fear was suddenly manifest. The mood preceded the event; we’d felt it coming and now here it was.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1641/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_017.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1641" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_017.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_017.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1600/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_019.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1600" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_019.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_019.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_018.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_018.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220106_AMERICA_018.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Tense times</b> <i>From top to bottom</i>: A Biden supporter wears a Trump costume on election day, Rose Marie Cromwell, 2020.

We quarrel, quietly, about what to call this act of electoral sabotage: insurrection (the left), wilding mob (the right) or unruly tourists (the hardcore Trumpists). The linguistic clash is, at bottom, a struggle over how this piece of history will be written: how bad it was, and who should be punished, who was implicated, whether Trump can legally be prevented from returning to power, and what to do next.</p><p class="article__body-text">Every day I read another article or post from an intelligent person arguing reasonably that our democracy is in danger or that a right-wing coup is already under way. If Trump wins another election, they say, the country will be lost. Newspaper columnists and television pundits warn of a conspiracy of voter suppression and gerrymandering; the installation of sympathetic bureaucrats and judges. That we teeter on the edge of losing everything is now an article of faith among half the country.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Against this dire backdrop I read allegations of civil-rights abuses of the January 6th defendants and passing questions about the expense and methods deployed to hunt them down. But those lines of inquiry are unpopular in Washington. The foot soldiers of the Capitol attack are the new terrorists of the respectable American imagination; they are beyond the pale. The boundary between the convicted assailants and those who simply share their ideology is perhaps left vague, but never mind. Nobody has ever accused Americans of dealing gently with threats.</p><p class="article__body-text">As for me, after watching other countries fall apart and sifting through the wreckage left behind, I am more unnerved by quieter erosions – by countless conversations with friends and family who suggest that our national project simply isn’t working anymore – than by the obvious drama of big events. I can’t separate our precarious political reality from my friend’s lost sense of her country, the faces of Floyd and his killer, the school closures, poverty and shame, the fires and riots, the pandemic and all the other unthinkable things that come in the night and leave us searching for a system that can bend the world back to a familiar shape.</p><p class="article__body-text">It’s hard to talk about these things. My friends do not want to hear that hanging on the edge of disaster is more or less a national tradition, nor to discuss whether American history can be read as a steady cycle of making a mess of things and then rebuilding from the wreckage. No matter how hard you fight these abstract battles, you can’t restore what was never there. I’m left wondering if we ever knew ourselves at all or whether, like our forefathers before us, we have fallen into the trap of believing our own mythology. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Megan Stack</b> is a contributing editor of <i>1843 magazine</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b><i>The exhibition “America in Crisis” runs from January 21st-April 3rd at the Saatchi Gallery in London, exploring social change in America from the 1960s to the present day.
