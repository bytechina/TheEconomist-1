The <small>un</small>’s Sustainable Development Goals require emissions to halve by 2030. They also aim to eradicate extreme poverty—defined as those living on less than $1.90 a day, measured at purchasing-power parity—by the same date. Are these two in conflict? Not as much as you might think.</p><p class="article__body-text">A study published in <i>Nature Sustainability</i> this week demonstrates how eliminating extreme poverty should not imperil efforts to mitigate climate change. A team led by Benedikt Bruckner of the University of Groningen has, for the first time, compiled a comprehensive estimate of the distribution of carbon consumption across 116 countries, accounting for 87% of the world’s population. The data cover 201 categories of spending on goods and services, such as rice and hairdressing. The researchers calculated the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> associated with each activity or product consumed—including both direct and indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions—across households, governments and companies. By linking spending to carbon footprints they were then able to split out the dirtiest and cleanest emitters in every country. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The research highlights enormous inequalities in emissions. It finds that the top 1% of global emitters were responsible for 15% of global emissions in 2014, while the bottom half accounted for just 10% of emissions. The average American had a carbon footprint 11 times larger than that of the average Indian. The top 20% of American emitters had an average footprint 400 times larger than that of the bottom 20% in sub-Saharan Africa. </p><p class="article__body-text">The researchers then model what effect poverty reduction might have on <small>ghg</small> emissions. Because they consume little, people living in extreme poverty typically have a tiny carbon footprint—emitting about one-tenth of the carbon of the average person on Earth. In 2014, the 350m Indians in extreme poverty were thought to account for just one-tenth of their country's emissions. Lifting them out of extreme poverty would increase India's emissions by just 4%. And lifting the 1.2bn people included in the analysis out of extreme poverty in 2014 is reckoned to lead to an increase of just 1% in global emissions. </p><p class="article__body-text">Of course, if every person on Earth consumed at the rate of the average American, carbon emissions would increase greatly—about three-fold. The environmental consequences of that scenario would be devastating. But even if 3.6bn people were lifted above a poverty line of $5.50 a day, emissions would increase by just 18%. By contrast, if the world's top 50% of emitters halved their carbon footprints, total emissions would fall by 40%. Although the burden of reducing carbon emissions will fall on all countries, the new research is a timely reminder to some governments that reducing poverty should not excuse their commitment to averting a climate disaster. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to <a href="/offthecharts/">Off the Charts</a>, our weekly newsletter.</i></p></div></body><script>
