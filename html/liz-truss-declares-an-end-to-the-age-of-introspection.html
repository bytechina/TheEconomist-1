It spent four years wrangling over Brexit, which was often more to do with how Britons felt about each other than about Brussels. Boris Johnson, a flop as foreign secretary elevated to Downing Street, uses international summits for playfights with the French over fish and sausages. Revelations about Downing Street’s illicit Christmas parties fill news channels; the fate of Ukraine does not.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/liz-truss-declares-an-end-to-the-age-of-introspection.mp3" title="Liz Truss declares an end to the age of introspection"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Tory <small>MP</small>s are tiring of their prime minister, and many like what they see in Liz Truss, who became foreign secretary in September’s reshuffle. She is the figurehead for a new foreign-policy doctrine: ideological; unhitched from Europe; seeking alliances beyond America; pitched squarely against China and Russia. The themes were spelled out in a security-policy review in March, but she is their most forceful advocate. If Global Britain means anything, it will be defined not by Mr Johnson but by Ms Truss.</p><p class="article__body-text">Her speech to Chatham House, a think-tank, on December 8th was dismissed by critics as facile and reductive. That misses its significance. It had a Manichean quality more familiar to American ears than to British ones. According to Ms Truss, an ideological battle is under way between the “free world” and the autocratic powers of China and Russia: a struggle between systems that serve the individual and those that put individuals at their service. “Non-aligned” states are pulled between the two orbits. She lamented the “age of introspection” that followed the cold war, when democracies nodded off, cutting defence spending and becoming distracted by home comforts and campus culture wars. Preoccupied abroad by the war on terror, they sucked up China’s cheap technology and Russia’s cheap gas, and kidded themselves that those countries were their partners.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Her response is to revive economic diplomacy, which she thinks is neglected. She imagines a “network of liberty”, spanning democracies and undemocratic allies that at least uphold international rules. She is keen for Britain to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal of modest economic value but in which she sees a bulwark against China. Britain is joining its allies to offer poor countries a rival source of infrastructure finance. Since David Cameron left Number 10 in 2016, Britain has made a Sinosceptic <small>U</small>-turn, but the shift was painted as pragmatic and technocratic. Ms Truss recasts it as something approaching a struggle for civilisation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Her vision is, in its essence, Thatcherite. The Chatham House speech held echoes of Margaret Thatcher’s warnings, as the Berlin Wall fell, against complacency and what Francis Fukuyama, then an up-and-coming political scientist, called the “end of history”. Some Tories think her a grating pastiche: she can be found on Instagram riding British tanks in Estonia (“the frontier of freedom”). She brushes off the comparison to Thatcher—it is made of any Conservative woman with strong views—but her supporters say she is a loyal student. She spent her childhood on anti-war marches with her parents, but was struck by the grim reality of their friends’ lives behind the Iron Curtain. She ditched their politics but kept their radicalism. She is one of several cabinet ministers itching for the supply-side reforms Brexit was meant to usher in.</p><p class="article__body-text">Over the past three decades the Foreign Office’s budget has been cut, and may yet be cut further. Ministers and mandarins holidayed as Kabul fell to the Taliban. Powers were hived off to rival ministries. Some are returning: last year it swallowed the international-development department. Ms Truss would like it to have more influence over trade, her previous remit.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">For British diplomats, she is a culture shock. Like Thatcher, she finds them too prone to abstraction. She was irritated by an internal memo describing their diplomacy as “honest and humble”. She wants them to be patriotic, and to advertise the freedoms that make Britain great. Sceptics in the Chatham House audience found the boosterism too much and the analysis simplistic; diplomacy means dealmaking in places where goodies and baddies are in short supply. Still, they were struck by her grasp during questions. Unlike Mr Johnson, she is good at getting Whitehall to do what she wants, says a former minister. Civil servants who don’t, and particularly the public-school-educated men who tend to get on her wrong side, can get a put-down and an eye-roll.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Johnson has damaged Britain’s standing in Washington, which sees him as a threat to peace in Northern Ireland. The trade deal that Brexiteers hoped for has not materialised. Ms Truss, for her part, fears America is becoming inward-looking and protectionist. The relationship is now “special but not exclusive”; Britain is strengthening security links with Australia, India and others.</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, Ms Truss’s idea of an ideological struggle with China converges with President Joe Biden’s. Her rise coincides with a new British energy in defending European security. Britain is being noticed again as a player if not a leader, says Ben Judah of the Atlantic Council, a Washington think-tank. It has been vocal on Russia’s threat to Ukraine, and quick to impose sanctions on Belarus and send troops to Poland to aid a migration crisis.</p><h2>Rise and shine</h2><p class="article__body-text">Tory Europhiles think Ms Truss is their best chance of a rapprochement with European governments. She voted Remain, but has since changed her mind on Brexit, saying that it has enlarged Britain’s diplomatic toolkit. Still, she stresses a bigger picture: that despite scraps over fish and sausages, European countries are fellow freedom-lovers in a tough world. It is a truth often lost on those Tories who mistook Brussels for tyranny. She thinks highly of Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s new Russia-sceptical foreign minister. At Chatham House she offered a modest olive branch, praising an <small>EU</small> aid scheme to counter Chinese loans. Setting aside quarrels with the neighbours will be the true test of whether Britain’s age of introspection is drawing to a close. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics:</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em><a href="./britains-new-suburbs-are-peculiar-places.html">Britain’s new suburbs are peculiar places</a> (Dec 11th)</em><br/><em><a href="./jordan-peterson-and-the-lobster.html">Jordan Peterson and the lobster</a> (Dec 4th)</em><br/><em><a href="./boris-johnson-should-pick-fights-with-conservative-institutions.html">Boris Johnson should pick fights with conservative institutions</a> (Nov 27th)</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Wakey wakey"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Liz%20Truss%20declares%20an%20end%20to%20the%20age%20of%20introspection&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fs5vfmvilaa3f7omjdba7nnvjlq7tj1ft&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
