Now it stands, perilously, in the open air. The entire rest of the front of the building, as well as much of the roof, was torn off by a tornado on the night of December 10th, which flattened a large part of the rest of the town. On December 14th, the congregation were serving coffee and breakfast buns to passers-by out of the shell. “It has been an experience,” said Debbie Fowler, a 68-year-old parishioner whose son is the pastor. “We were so sick at heart to see it, it’s devastating.” But, she says, the town will come back. “It won’t look the same, but the people will be the same. This is a close-knit community,” she says.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-tornado-damage-in-kentucky-could-take-decades-to-repair.mp3" title="The tornado damage in Kentucky could take decades to repair"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The tornado that hit Mayfield was the worst to have hit America since one destroyed much of Joplin, Missouri, in 2011. As well as tearing up Mayfield, it wrecked buildings in five other states across the Midwest and South. By December 15th, 88 people were known to have been killed, 74 of whom were in Kentucky. Dozens more were still missing, while hundreds have been made homeless. Andy Beshear, Kentucky’s governor, described it as the “worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event” in his state’s history. On December 15th Joe Biden visited Mayfield to survey the damage himself, and announced federal aid to cover the costs of rebuilding. And yet recovery from natural disasters is rarely easy. The population of New Orleans is still 20% lower today than it was before Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Many smaller towns like Mayfield have struggled to retain population even without tornadoes. Will it really bounce back?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">When your correspondent arrived, volunteers from all over Kentucky, and even further afield, had set up stalls to hand out food, water and other essentials. Fire departments were busy clearing the roads. Generators had been hauled in to provide power. “The town is not going to quit because of this,” says John Darnell, who drove in from his home in a neighbouring county to drop off supplies. “They’re too resourceful.” And yet volunteers rushing in is not the main determinant of how easily somewhere recovers. Sam Anselm, who was assistant city manager in Joplin when it was hit, says the town got a lot of donations of clothes and toys, and then had to find space to store them. “Really what we needed was a gift card or cheque,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text">What matters more is having a good plan, says Elaina Sutley, who studies disaster recovery at the University of Kansas. A well-organised local government can marshall an enormous amount of federal and state resources. But smaller towns often do not have the ready expertise to work out which grants to apply for, or what to do with them. Political conflict can stifle the ability to use money well. “There is a window of opportunity that does not last very long after each disaster,” she says.</p><p class="article__body-text">Sadly, as in so many things, a town’s existing wealth is an important factor. Where most residents affected are homeowners and decently insured, they can often recover quickly, by enlisting private sector resources to rebuild their homes. Poorer places, with lots of renters, are more likely to suffer permanently, as people whose homes are damaged leave. What you sometimes see, says Ms Sutley, is that “some pieces of the town look really great, and other parts get left behind.” Joplin has largely recovered, partly thanks to decent leadership, but also because its housing stock was well-insured.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Whether Mayfield will thrive is yet to be seen. The median household income in the town is just $32,200, much lower than the national figure of $67,500. Poverty will prove a challenge. At a community centre shelter in Wingo, a town around 10 miles away, one evacuee, Evonda Murdock, says this is the second time she has been forced to move recently. A few months before, her landlord had evicted her and her son, forcing them to live in a hotel. “I don’t know what we are going to do now,” she says. America has an enormous amount of compassion when catastrophe arrives. But more day-to-day support for the vulnerable would help too. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "The long road back"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20tornado%20damage%20in%20Kentucky%20could%20take%20decades%20to%20repair&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frmpp2itmevv4f2n0m0tkibhcd7r2elgo&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
