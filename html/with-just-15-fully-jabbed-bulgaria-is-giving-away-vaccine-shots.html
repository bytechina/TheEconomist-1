A few hours later the national ministry of health said no such thing would happen, calling the announcement a bureaucratic mistake. Chaotic messaging is just one reason why Bulgaria has seen so much death during the pandemic, and is bracing for more.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/with-just-15-fully-jabbed-bulgaria-is-giving-away-vaccine-shots.mp3" title="With just 15% fully jabbed, Bulgaria is giving away vaccine shots"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Among 84 countries tracked by <em>The Economist, </em>Bulgaria ranks second (after Peru) on excess deaths per 100,000 people since the start of the pandemic, meaning deaths above the usual rate. After a summer lull, cases are rising again as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads. Hospitals are preparing for yet another onslaught. Only 15% of Bulgarians are fully vaccinated, the lowest rate in the <small>EU</small>, where the overall share is 52%.</p><p class="article__body-text">Bulgarians who want to can easily get any of the four covid-19 vaccines approved in the <small>EU</small>. But demand has been so low that authorities are trying to sell or donate hundreds of thousands of doses that will expire soon to other countries.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/701/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210814_EUC208.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20210814_EUC208.png" srcset="../image/20210814_EUC208.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Historically, Bulgarians have had little trust in official advice. Circumventing rules of all sorts is a national pastime. Many people are suspicious of the jabs because they are new; some think the virus does not exist, and that measures against the pandemic are a conspiracy. Only a handful of prominent politicians have had themselves vaccinated on television, or are urging people to get a jab.</p><p class="article__body-text">That is partly because of political turbulence. Two rounds of elections this year have failed to produce a government. Neither Boyko Borisov, who served as prime minister for most of the past 12 years, nor the caretaker cabinet that replaced him after his government fell in April have mounted a serious public-information campaign to combat fake news about the vaccines. “Anyone who reads three articles on social media thinks he is an expert,” says Angel Kunchev, the country’s chief health inspector.</p><p class="article__body-text">Watching Bulgarian television can leave you confused. A few covid-sceptical doctors are regularly invited on talk shows. Some advise people with medical conditions that would place them in priority vaccination groups in most countries against getting jabbed. About 30% of doctors and 60% of nurses are unvaccinated.</p><p class="article__body-text">Dr Kunchev says this is partly because infectious diseases and immunology are barely covered in medical-school curriculums. As hospital admissions for covid-19 climb again, demand for vaccinations seems to be picking up. But, as with most of Bulgaria’s handling of the pandemic, the uptick is too little and too late. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="./page-not-found.html">coronavirus hub</a>.
