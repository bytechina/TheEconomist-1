How contagious is it, and how deadly? Which mutations will emerge, and where will they go? As SARS-CoV-2 moves from novel threat to an endemic disease, no one knows how it will continue to evolve. What is known is that some new variants of the virus are especially concerning, as they are more contagious or more deadly than the original virus that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. The latest is Omicron, first identified in a sample taken in southern Africa on November 8th. According to sequencing of genomic samples, Omicron is now the dominant strain around the world. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"> The covid-19 pandemic has upended the lives of billions of people since it struck Wuhan.

Although the true toll, as estimated by our <a href="/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates">covid-19 excess-mortality model</a>, puts the figure at between 14m and 24.5m people.
