That was why Jack Bogle founded Vanguard, an American asset manager, in 1975. In the long run, almost all actively managed investment funds fail to beat the average market return. Paying fund managers hefty fees to pick stocks for you is not just pointless, but damaging. Much better to invest in low-cost “passive” (that is, automated) funds that buy the whole market.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/vanguards-big-push-into-financial-advice.mp3" title="Vanguard’s big push into financial advice"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">A half-century later around a third of the £9.4trn ($12.8trn; 4.6 times <small>GDP</small>) looked after by Britain’s fund managers is invested passively. Vanguard is a behemoth overseeing assets worth $8.2trn globally. The world’s most famous stock-picker, Warren Buffett, describes Mr Bogle as “a hero”. And Vanguard has chosen a new industry to shake up: personal financial advice.</p><p class="article__body-text">In Britain, that is big business. St James’s Place, a wealth-management firm, reckons that British retail savers have liquid assets worth £3.4trn, and £1.2trn more in personal pensions and life-insurance investments. Around 36,000 financial advisers make their living telling people how to invest. They also advise on saving for retirement, which funds to buy and in what proportions, which broker to use and how to avoid overpaying tax. Some have built large, profitable companies. St James’s Place is a <small>FTSE</small> 100 firm with nearly 4,500 advisers. Its revenues in 2020 were £14bn.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Yet much of the potential market remains untapped. Boring Money, a consultancy, thinks there are 12.7m adults with more than £10,000 in savings, no financial adviser—and limited confidence in their ability to invest on their own account. Rising longevity, low returns on cash and the closure of most defined-benefit pension schemes mean that individuals must do more to plan for their own retirements. But absorbing 12.7m new clients would require each financial adviser to take on 353.</p><p class="article__body-text">For a human adviser meeting clients in person, that would be impossible. But not for an algorithm. And it turns out that much financial advice is just as automatable as passive fund management is. Working out how much someone needs to save each month to retire at a given age and with a given income takes nothing more than a model for asset growth and some arithmetic. For most people, tax planning just means making the most of tax-sheltered savings accounts and pension allowances. As for which broker to use, the answer is “the cheapest”. Allocating savings between equities and bonds depends on risk tolerance and time to retirement, but mostly boils down to following a flow chart.</p><p class="article__body-text">Clients with elaborate affairs will still benefit from bespoke advice, says Holly Mackay of Boring Money. But “if you just want to invest your money with the comfort that you’re not being a wally, digital advice gives you that.” It is also far cheaper than the traditional kind. The Financial Conduct Authority (<small>FCA</small>) estimated in 2020 that the average cost of investing with a traditional adviser was 1.9% of the assets invested each year. For an automated one, that fell to 0.8%. Over time that gap compounds, with extraordinary effect. If you invest £100,000 in assets that grow by 5% a year for 30 years and pay an annual fee of 1.9%, you end up with £246,074. If the fee falls to 0.8%, you end up with £340,577.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Despite all this, 90-95% of the market in financial advice is still in person, the <small>FCA</small> reckons. Hence Vanguard’s push to disrupt the industry by adding a personal-investment service to its index funds. It started providing a direct platform to invest in its funds in 2017 (previously they were available only through brokers), and included personal pensions in 2020. In April 2021 it added a personal financial-advice offering with fees of 0.79% per year, and saw client numbers rocket. It now has 361,000 in Britain, over half of whom were gained in 2021.</p><p class="article__body-text">The 2010s saw a flurry of “robo advice” firms incorporated with similar aims, only to flounder. Many hoped that spending heavily on launch marketing would yield enough customers that word of mouth would then become self-sustaining, says Jeremy Fawcett of Platforum, a consultancy. If such a critical mass exists, none of them reached it. Nutmeg, the most prominent, was founded in 2011 but manages only £3.5bn. It is yet to turn a profit, and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase last June.</p><p class="article__body-text">But where startups have failed, an established giant may have more luck. Vanguard’s heft makes it easier to sustain a prolonged marketing push, and in any case it is already well-known as a low-cost investment provider. The timing is also propitious. Ms Mackay points out that the need to access many services online during the pandemic has made people much more willing to consider digital advice. Around half of the 12.7m people currently falling in the “advice gap” would prefer it to the face-to-face kind, implying an immediate potential market of £355bn. And Vanguard’s track record in America, where it has been offering a similar service since 2015, is encouraging. By September 2021 it was managing assets worth $259bn.</p><h2>Alexa, when can I retire?</h2><p class="article__body-text">None of this marks the death of the human financial adviser. Older savers tend to be warier of automated services and those, like Vanguard’s, where they can speak to a human only over the phone. The one-size-fits-all approach of digital advice makes it less appropriate for clients with complicated affairs, for example those who must consider inheritance or business ownership. But the vastly lower cost of automated advice should give incumbents pause for thought. A common reason for savers to shun face-to-face financial advice is that they think they can’t afford it. Looking at the new services, many existing clients may decide that they can’t, either. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Automatic for the people"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Vanguard%E2%80%99s%20big%20push%20into%20financial%20advice&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-13&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ft5mi2rqkjgjs8d2ipm3ufnoh6mfi7fhr&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
