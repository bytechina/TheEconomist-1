Sluggish institutions were being electrified, and long-suppressed energies unleashed. He is leaving during another Conservative revolution. But this time the chance of success looks slimmer. Boris Johnson lacks Margaret Thatcher’s self-discipline and command of detail, as demonstrated by his bizarre speech to the Confederation of British Industry, a lobby group, on November 22nd. The prime minister lost his place, mimicked car sounds and waxed lyrical about a children’s television character, Peppa Pig.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/boris-johnson-should-pick-fights-with-conservative-institutions.mp3" title="Boris Johnson should pick fights with conservative institutions"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Johnson is struggling against stiffer headwinds than faced by his predecessor. Britain’s population is older than in the 1980s, meaning that state spending on health and social care is crowding out investment in the future. The Conservative Party is older still. In 1983 more 18- to 24-year-olds voted for Thatcher’s Tories than for Labour under Michael Foot; Mr Johnson relies on support from retired people who want nothing to disturb their quiet lives. Thatcher had clear plans based on simple principles: privatisation, deregulation, value for money. Mr Johnson’s self-appointed task, to “level up” Britain, is vague, even Utopian. Voters could judge Thatcher’s progress in red tape untangled and state enterprises privatised. The path to being levelled up lacks similar milestones.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Here are some ideas for giving Mr Johnson’s policies Thatcherite bite. Pick institutions that stand in the way of levelling up. Subject them to rapid and wholesale reform. And confound your enemies by choosing targets on the Tory end of the political spectrum, namely the great “public” (that is, private) schools, the City and the House of Lords.</p><p class="article__body-text">Britain’s private schools are a troubling mixture of excellence and social exclusivity. At any given moment just 7% of all pupils, and 15% of those aged 16 and over, are being educated privately. Yet that 15% gains half of all <small>A</small> and <small>A</small>* grades at <small>A</small>-level, and a third of all Oxbridge places. It is also over-represented in elite sports (especially cycling, rugby and rowing), acting and—how John Lennon must be spinning in his grave—popular music. Fees at public schools are so high—a year at Eton now costs almost £50,000 ($67,000)—that they have become playgrounds for the offspring of global plutocrats and oligarchs.</p><p class="article__body-text">This is a disgrace. Public schools were founded to educate “poor and needy scholars”, to quote from the founding document of one, Winchester. They enjoy charitable status because they supposedly serve the common good. In 1942 Winston Churchill argued that they should be obliged to give 60-70% of their places to poor scholars on bursaries. Mr Johnson, a scholarship boy himself, should revive his hero’s idea. This would not only end Britain’s educational apartheid, but also give the country a welcome injection of diverse talent.</p><p class="article__body-text">One great beneficiary of Thatcher’s reforms was the City of London, shaken from its claret-induced slumbers by global competition. But as the tyros of the Big Bang became lords and ladies of the Establishment, it nodded off again. The London Stock Exchange (<small>LSE</small>) increasingly looks like a care home for old-economy companies, rather than a cradle for new-economy ones. Less than 2% of the <small>FTSE</small> 100’s value is accounted for by tech firms, compared with 40% of the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> 500’s. Overly fussy regulations mean that British companies must support an army of ageing, out-of-touch non-executive directors. The City’s refusal to countenance dual-class share structures means fewer options for founders who want to tap public markets without bowing to the dictatorship of quarterly earnings. Allowing dual-class firms to join the <small>LSE</small>’s premium segment could reconnect the bourse with the new economy and help the City do for today’s high-tech companies what it did for the railways in the Victorian age.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It is not unusual to meet foreigners who say that they admire Britain’s private schools or financial services (in many areas other than equities, the City is still world-leading). But whoever says that about the House of Lords? For most of its history it embodied the hereditary principle: aristocrats exercised veto power over legislation because an ancestor had shed blood for William the Conqueror or slept with Charles II. That changed with the introduction of life peerages in 1958 and the reduction of the “hereditaries” to a rump of 92 in 1999—but only by replacing one bad principle with another, political patronage.</p><p class="article__body-text">Now party bosses nominate whomever they like to sit on the red benches: ex-ministers, cronies, relatives—and moneymen. Fifteen of the past 16 Tory party treasurers, all of whom donated at least £3m to the party, have been given seats in the House of Lords. But this is not only “Tory sleaze”: Labour under Tony Blair was equally keen on “cash for honours”. And inter-party competition has swelled membership of the Lords to around 800, all of them entitled to more than £300 a day simply for turning up.</p><p class="article__body-text">A case can be made for abolishing the second chamber and entrusting legislative scrutiny to committees of the House of Commons, backed up by outside specialists. If it is to stay, it should be rebuilt from the ground up. Germany gets by with just 69 members in its upper chamber and America with 100, so Britain could surely cope with, say, 200. And the principle of patronage needs to go. Why not replace it with something fitted to Mr Johnson’s self-appointed task of regional rebalancing? Allocate seats in the New Lords to regional mayors and selected members of the devolved parliaments in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh, and move it from London to Manchester, the emerging capital of the North.</p><h2>Get motoring</h2><p class="article__body-text">An education system that offers greater opportunities to talented children; a financial system in step with the tech economy; a political system that is less corrupt and more representative of the entire country—and all at no cost to the Treasury. What is Mr Johnson waiting for? Vroom vroom. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Read more from Bagehot, our columnist on British politics:</strong><br/><em><a href="./britains-establishment-has-split-into-two-each-convinced-it-is-the-underdog.html">Britain’s establishment has split into two, each convinced it is the underdog</a> (Nov 20th)</em><br/><em><a href="./21806201.html">How Boris Johnson’s failure to tackle sleaze among MPs could prove costly</a> (Nov 10th)</em><br/><em><a href="./boris-johnsons-conservatives-plan-to-create-a-bigger-busier-state.html">Boris Johnson’s Conservatives plan to create a bigger, busier state</a> (Nov 6th)</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Some modest proposals"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Boris%20Johnson%20should%20pick%20fights%20with%20conservative%20institutions&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-27&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F5j002dkd37ecs7anclvl8mm0ubvra2vf&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
