She is one of many hundreds who, since Chile eased its covid-related curfew in October, have gone out on the streets to rail against the government. Some protesters have looted supermarkets and pharmacies. Others, wearing black balaclavas, have thrown Molotov cocktails at “<em>pacos</em>”, or the police. For a week the main thoroughfare of the capital was full of piles of rubbish that had been set on fire. The downtown area is covered with graffiti. “Death to the government, long live anarchy,” reads one scrawl.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/chile-once-considered-latin-americas-finland-is-in-trouble.mp3" title="Chile, once considered Latin America’s Finland, is in trouble"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Chile used to be one of Latin America’s success stories. <small>GDP</small> per person almost tripled between 1990 and 2015; it is now the highest in Latin America. The number of university students quintupled over the same period. Income inequality fell and is now below the regional average (though far above that of the <small>OECD</small>, a club mostly of rich countries). Yet ever since huge protests took place in October 2019, in which at least 30 people died and metro stations and churches were razed, violence has become far more common. In the past few weeks three people have died during the protests and hundreds have been arrested.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">After the protests in 2019 the government agreed to create a constitutional convention—the idea being that, by electing a body broadly representative of Chile’s citizens in order to rewrite the constitution from the era of the dictator Augusto Pinochet, discontent could be channelled into better responses than populism and anarchy. But two years on, as that democratic experiment gets under way (with just 43% of citizens voting for the 155 members of the convention in May), Chile looks in worse shape than at any point since the return of democracy three decades ago.</p><p class="article__body-text">For a start, extremist politicians are gaining ground. In November, a general election will take place in which the centre-right president, Sebastián Piñera, cannot stand again because of term limits (separately, he is also dealing with potential impeachment proceedings). The two politicians leading the polls to replace him are Gabriel Boric, a 35-year-old allied with the Communist Party, and José Antonio Kast, a hard-right candidate who once claimed that if Pinochet were alive, “he would vote for me.” Mr Kast wants to build “a ditch” on the country’s northern border to keep out immigrants who arrive illegally. Mr Boric’s team argue that their policies are no more extreme than, say, those of Bernie Sanders, a former presidential candidate in the United States. Even so, they seem beholden to radical leftists.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another problem is that many of the underlying issues which brought people out onto the streets two years ago have not gone away. In the early 2000s, during a commodities boom, a new middle class emerged but inequality remained severe. According to a study published in 2019 in the<em> Lancet</em>, a medical journal, life expectancy at birth for a woman born in the poorest neighbourhood of Santiago is nearly 18 years lower than for a woman born in the richest neighbourhood, a much larger gap than in the other five Latin American cities surveyed, including Mexico City and Buenos Aires. (Although overall life expectancy remains high.)</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">University tuition fees are high, but the quality of degrees is often shoddy. More than 80% of pensioners receive pensions that are below the minimum wage of 337,000 pesos ($418) a month. There were large protests in 2006, 2011 and 2016 calling for reforms to these areas, but many feel little has changed. Those who can afford to seek private schools and health care. This year Cristóbal Rovira Kaltwasser, a political scientist, published a survey of 137 managers and board members from the country's largest 500 companies. Just under half said their parents were educated in private schools, but 96% said their children were.</p><p class="article__body-text">Those in power often seem unconcerned by the gulf between the rich and the poor. After raising metro fares at peak hours in October 2019, Juan Andrés Fontaine, the economy minister, said Chileans could “wake up earlier” if they wanted to avoid paying the higher costs. Few Chileans set much store by the political system. Trust in institutions is low (see chart); electoral participation is exceptionally so.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211030_AMC825.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211030_AMC825.png" srcset="../image/20211030_AMC825.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The Pinochet-era constitution, adopted in 1980, was designed to give a disproportionate role to the right, argues Claudia Heiss of the University of Chile. Seats were reserved for the army in the Senate (which remained the case until 2005), while unusually high thresholds were put in place to change laws that would give the state a bigger role in the provision of certain services, such as education. Despite the fact that centre-left presidents have mostly been in power, they had to negotiate extensively with the opposition. This made politics seem like “a cartel”, says Steven Levitksy of Harvard University.</p><p class="article__body-text">Initially, it seemed that writing a new constitution could help bring more legitimacy to a discredited system. Last year the turnout for the referendum over whether or not a new constitution should be written was, at 51%, among the highest since voting became voluntary in 2012 (78% voted yes). Young and poor people’s participation grew the most. Though Chileans’ trust in the convention has recently dipped, it is still far above that in Congress and political parties. Juan Pablo Luna, a political scientist at Chile’s Catholic University, claims that the convention has led to a “revindication of politics” among young people.</p><p class="article__body-text">But liberals are increasingly alarmed by the direction that the convention, stuffed full of political newbies, is taking. In early October, the assembly finished approving its rules of procedure. One of these imposes penalties for “denial or omission” of human-rights violations committed by the dictatorship and by the state in the context of the 2019 uprising. The vagueness of the rule is worrying, thinks Sergio Verdugo, a constitutional expert. His concern is that the convention’s indifferent approach to freedom of speech could be reflected in the final constitution.</p><p class="article__body-text">Similarly a group led by the Communist Party is trying to circumvent rules that mean every part of the charter is approved by a two-thirds majority. Indeed, leftists have the most sway in the assembly. “This will be the world’s first woke constitution,” thinks Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">All this will affect the economy, which has been scarred by a long lockdown. Stricter environmental rules—almost certainly included in the new constitution—may hinder copper exports, on which the economy depends. Senators are close to approving a bill to let Chileans make an early withdrawal of 10% of their pension pots. This would be the fourth time such an emergency measure has passed since covid-19 started squeezing family budgets. It is likely to spur annual inflation, which hit a seven-year high of 5.3% last month.</p><p class="article__body-text">Meanwhile the violence is likely to continue. On October 8th a leftist member of the convention was hounded by an angry mob in Santiago, who hurled stones at her and branded her a “sell-out” for contemplating working with centrist members. Chile’s more aspirational politicians have often compared the country to Finland. But the events of recent weeks and years suggest that it actually resembles one of its dysfunctional neighbours.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Fuelling the flames"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Chile%2C%20once%20considered%20Latin%20America%E2%80%99s%20Finland%2C%20is%20in%20trouble&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-28&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fjv7vpp4nkogarp593j6asrrhjkav0lgo&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
