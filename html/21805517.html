On November 24th <small>DART</small> should follow. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, though, has a more practical purpose than <em>Lucy</em>. It will assess the feasibility of changing an asteroid’s path, should one be discovered that threatens to collide with Earth.</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>DART</small>, a probe weighing 600kg, is intended to crash, in September 2022, into Dimorphos, a tiny asteroid in orbit around a larger one, Didymos, at a velocity of 6.2km per second. The intention is to alter the speed of Dimorphos’s orbit by about half a millimetre a second, thus shortening its orbital period, now 11.9 hours, by about ten minutes.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Didymos is 780 metres across. According to the project’s lead investigator, Andrew Cheng of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, if an object that size hit Earth it could devastate half a continent, causing firestorms and a subsequent cooling of the climate that might last for years. But even something the size of Dimorphos, only 160 metres across, would do a lot of damage. Its impact would create an explosion equivalent to 400-600 megatonnes of <small>TNT</small>. By comparison, the Tunguska bolide that exploded over Siberia in 1908, flattening more than 2,000km<sup>2</sup> of forest, released something like 20 megatonnes. And recently published evidence suggests that an explosion of similar size to Tunguska destroyed Tall el-Hammam, a city in the Jordan valley, in about 1650<small>BC</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are, moreover, a lot of unknown asteroids out there. <small>NASA</small>’s Near-Earth Object Observation Programme, intended to discover 90% of asteroids larger than 140 metres across that have orbits near Earth’s, is reckoned to have so far found less than half of them. None yet located is seen as a threat. But if such a threat were identified, the question would be whether anything could be done about it.</p><p class="article__body-text">If collision with Earth was imminent, the answer is probably “no”. But if it were years or decades away, a nudge of the sort <small>DART</small> will give Dimorphos could change a space rock’s path enough for it to miss Earth after all—even a tiny alteration in such a body’s orbit will grow over time.</p><p class="article__body-text">Dimorphos’s behaviour after <small>DART</small> hits it will thus be the subject of intense scrutiny. The impact itself will be monitored by <small>LICIA</small>Cube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids). This is a small craft, built by Italy’s space agency, which will be launched along with <small>DART</small> and separate from it shortly before impact. After that, Didymos and Dimorphos will be tracked by ground-based telescopes. Then, in 2024, the European Space Agency will launch a follow-up craft called <em>Hera</em> that will arrive at the double asteroid in 2026, for a more detailed inspection. All these data will then be crunched to find out just how feasible an asteroid-deflection mission would be.</p><p class="article__body-text">With luck, no such mission will ever be needed. But if one is, <small>DART</small> may prove to be the most important space probe ever to have flown.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Science &amp; technology section of the print edition under the headline "Nudge, nudge"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=An%20exploration%20of%20Earth%E2%80%99s%20defences%20will%20launch%20next%20month&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-13&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fggp625pqk5kqnr92kbq5jm6920agdoa6&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
