However, this ill-advised approach does offer one silver lining: it lets economists measure how much businesses change their behaviour when the proverbial parents are out of town.</p><p class="article__body-text">A new paper by Eric Zou of the University of Oregon makes use of satellite images to spy on polluters at times when they think no one is watching. <small>NASA</small>, America’s space agency, publishes data on the concentration of aerosol particles—ranging from natural dust to man-made toxins—all around the world, as seen from space. For every day in 2001-13, Mr Zou compiled these readings in the vicinity of each of America’s 1,200 air-monitoring sites.</p><p class="article__body-text">Although some stations provided data continuously, 30-50% of them sent reports only once every six days. For these sites, Mr Zou studied how aerosol levels varied based on whether data would be reported.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="20210821_GDC100_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">Sure enough, the air was consistently cleaner in these areas on monitoring days than it was the rest of the time, by a margin of 1.6%. Reporting schedules were almost certainly the cause: in areas where stations were retired, average pollution levels on monitoring days promptly rose to match the readings on non-monitoring days.</p><p class="article__body-text">The size of this “pollution gap” differed by region. It was biggest in parts of Appalachia and the Midwest with lots of mining, and in the northern Mountain West, where paper and lumber mills are common.</p><p class="article__body-text">The magnitude of the gap also depended on the cost of being caught. Every year, the <small>EPA</small> produces a list of counties whose average air quality falls below minimum standards. The punishments for inclusion are costly: factories become subject to burdensome clean-technology requirements, and local governments can be fined.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="20210821_GDC300_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">When firms risked facing sanctions, they seemed to game the system more aggressively. In counties that exceeded the <small>PM</small><sub>2.5</sub> limit in a given month, the pollution gap in the following month swelled to 7%. In all other cases, it was just 1.2%.</p><p class="article__body-text">The end of the one-in-six schedule is in sight. Thanks in part to a cash-incentive scheme for continuous-measurement systems, just 10% of stations now report every sixth day. However, <small>PM</small><sub>2.5</sub> are so dangerous that even this small share causes severe harm. If switching these stations to continuous reporting were to cause pollution on non-monitoring days to fall to the level seen on monitoring days, it would yield a 1.3% reduction in <small>PM</small><sub>2.5</sub> exposure for 10% of America’s population. Using a standard academic estimate of the impact of such particles on life expectancy, this amounts to just over one extra day of life per affected resident, for a total of 105,000 life-years. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text" data-interactive-class="g-interactive-source">Source: “Unwatched pollution: the effect of intermittent monitoring on air quality”, by Eric Yongchen Zou, 2021</p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline "We were expecting you"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Poorly%20devised%20regulation%20lets%20firms%20pollute%20with%20abandon&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fjjhkvinq2d7ejif5g99hcgbqqi466gi1&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body><script>
