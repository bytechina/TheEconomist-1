Sunset legislation, as it was called, would have an expiry date, upon which politicians could decide whether to renew it. In theory, useless laws would vanish. In practice, sunsets have morphed into a legislative device that serves almost the exact opposite purpose: a way to mask policy costs. The Build Back Better bill, Joe Biden’s signature social-spending package, is the latest and most egregious case.</p><p class="article__body-text">The headline cost of the bill, which passed the House on November 19th but faces a bumpy path in the Senate, is roughly $2trn over a decade. That is less than 1% of <small>GDP</small> per year, which may not sound like much. However, ample use of sunsets means the real cost could be twice as large. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan organisation, thinks it would cost $4.8trn if all temporary measures (expensive family-related policies in the main) were extended.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Longer-term implications would be starker. The White House says that Build Back Better will not add to America’s debt. By contrast, the Penn Wharton Budget Model, an academic initiative, calculates it would raise debts by 25% by 2050 if sunsets are made permanent. Such precise projections should be taken with a pinch of salt. But the message is clear: Build Back Better is likely to cost far more than advertised.</p><p class="article__body-text">For Democrats today, as for previous Republican administrations, that is the point. By setting early expirations, they are putting a cap on the costs that are assessed by the Congressional Budget Office (<small>CBO</small>), a non-partisan agency which is a crucial scorekeeper. The <small>CBO</small> only assesses what is in bills as written. So, for example, the child tax credit, a payment to families with young children, would cost $190bn in the one year that it is slated to last in the Build Back Better bill. Were it to become permanent—the objective of progressive Democrats—its cost could rocket to more than $1trn over the next decade.</p><p class="article__body-text">Why bother with the budgetary tricks if they are so transparent? For the George W. Bush, the first president to make extensive use of sunsets, the idea was to make sure that his tax cuts complied with a Senate rule against increasing deficits beyond a ten-year window. Setting the expiry date just before the ten-year mark was a loophole. Donald Trump followed a similar template with his tax cuts in 2017. Those crafting the sunsets hope that when expiry arrives, the measures will be popular enough that lawmakers will keep them. There is precedent for this. The vast majority of Mr Bush’s tax cuts were indeed made permanent under Barack Obama.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the case of Build Back Better, the Democrats are using sunsets in the hopes of bridging an intra-party split. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, senators from West Virginia and Arizona, respectively, whose votes are needed for the bill to pass, both balked at an initial $3.5trn proposal as too expensive. Rather than jettison some of their cherished plans, their fellow Democrats scaled back their duration, crossing their fingers that, once on the books, they will ultimately be extended.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Yet in the process, they have created a jumble of expiry dates. Tax credits for low-income workers and children would last for just one year. A top-up for health insurance would run for four, while funding for child care and pre-kindergarten would for six. The fiscal ramifications only get more complicated because Mr Trump’s eight-year sunsets enacted in 2017 would overlap with the new ones, says Kent Smetters of Penn Wharton. The expiration of a Trump-era child tax credit would nearly double the annual cost of Mr Biden’s version.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another concern is what the sunsets cover. Applying expiry dates to pieces of the tax code is bad enough, sowing uncertainty in the economy. In Build Back Better, entire programmes will be at stake. “With universal pre-kindergarten, you’re finding buildings, hiring teachers and enrolling families. And then with sunset provisions, the federal funding may just go away,” says Lori Esposito Murray of the Committee for Economic Development of the Conference Board, a public-policy organisation. Sunsets may seem a clever way to get pet programmes through a divided congress. But they are also setting them up for failure. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America, <a href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "House of the rising sunset"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20Democrats%20use%20a%20loophole%20to%20mask%20the%20cost%20of%20Joe%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20big%20bill&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Flag4fr6ac2c2q79jge61eog8ogdehvl2&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
