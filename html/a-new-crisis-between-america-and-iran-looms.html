It refused to speak directly to American officials in the six rounds of talks in Vienna that ended in June (it negotiated instead with European, Russian and Chinese intermediaries). It has not resumed formal negotiations since, citing the need for personnel changes after the election as president in June of <a href="./ebrahim-raisi-appears-to-have-won-a-rigged-election-in-iran.html">Ebrahim Raisi</a>, a hardliner. Talks could resume in November, Iran says.</p><p class="article__body-text">Iran is spinning up a growing stock of 60% enriched uranium, which is a hair’s breadth away from bomb-grade stuff. The acceleration has been helped by Iran’s deployment of more, and more sophisticated, centrifuges to purify the fissile material. Other alarming developments include the conversion of enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into uranium metal—for which the most likely use is in bombs—and the hampering of inspections by the <small>UN</small>’s International Atomic Energy Agency.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">All told, Iran’s “breakout time”—the time it would need to make one bomb’s-worth of highly enriched uranium—has shrunk to about a month, calculates David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security, a think-tank. American officials put it at “a few months”. Either way, it is much shorter than the year or more that the world enjoyed when the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (<small>JCPOA</small>), was in force. (Putting a nuclear warhead on a missile would take perhaps another two years.)</p><p class="article__body-text">Among Iran-watchers in Washington, there is a sense of foreboding about an approaching showdown. “The runway is getting shorter,” says Antony Blinken, the secretary of state. On October 13th he warned that America “is prepared to turn to other options” to prevent an Iranian bomb—without saying what these might be.</p><p class="article__body-text">Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is blunter: “Iran’s nuclear programme has hit a watershed moment. And so has our tolerance,” he told the <small>UN</small> General Assembly last month. Israel makes little secret of its covert campaign to assassinate Iran’s nuclear scientists and sabotage its facilities. “Operations to destroy Iranian capabilities will continue—in various arenas and at any time,” said Israel’s military chief, Aviv Kochavi. Iran is the main subject of a flurry of diplomatic meetings, including one between Mr Blinken, Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, and his Emirati counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed.</p><p class="article__body-text">The looming crisis was predictable from the day Mr Trump withdrew from the <small>JCPOA</small>, calling it “the worst deal ever”. The deal had placed limits on the Iranian nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of many, but not all, international economic sanctions. Mr Trump’s new barrage of sanctions was intended to exert “maximum pressure”. But it failed to compel Iran to accept more stringent terms. Nor did it halt the country’s development of ballistic missiles, or its support for client militias around the Middle East.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Biden campaigned on a promise to restore the <small>JCPOA</small>. In office, he retained most of Mr Trump’s sanctions in the hope of preserving America’s bargaining power. But as the nuclear programme accelerates, it is Iran that is now exerting “maximum pressure” on Mr Biden, argues Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank.</p><p class="article__body-text">In Iran’s view, America has proven itself untrustworthy, as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has long warned. The economic benefits of the <small>JCPOA</small> were short-lived. And Iran thinks it has withstood the worst economic pressure that America can apply. Sanctions, compounded by covid-19 and oil prices that until recently were low, have hurt a lot. The economy contracted by 6% in 2018 and 7% in 2019. The rial has lost 85% of its value since 2017 and annual inflation recently surged to 45%.</p><p class="article__body-text">But now the economy is improving. The <small>IMF</small> estimated in April that it would grow by 3% this year, and that was before the recent spike in oil prices. China has become the biggest buyer of Iran’s oil, and is incorporating it into its Belt and Road infrastructure scheme. Russia is talking of integrating Iran into a Eurasian trade group.</p><p class="article__body-text">Regionally, too, Iran has become more powerful. It has helped to save Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria and defended its friends in Iraq from the jihadists of Islamic State. To the south, its Houthi allies in Yemen have forced a Saudi-led military coalition to seek a way out of the war. In Afghanistan, the Americans have been chased away by the Taliban. Even America’s allies in the Gulf have started trying to patch up relations with the theocracy.</p><p class="article__body-text">Iran claims it seeks to build only a nuclear-power industry. But it seems determined at least to develop the wherewithal to make nuclear bombs at short notice. The <small>JCPOA</small> was hardly a permanent solution to the problem. It allowed Iran to continue enrichment and to experiment with more-sophisticated centrifuges, but under tight limits. “Sunset clauses” would remove most of these restrictions after eight, ten and 15 years (a tightened inspection regime would go on indefinitely). These compromises provoked intense opposition by the Republicans and parts of the Democratic Party, whipped up by Mr Bennett’s predecessor, Binyamin Netanyahu.</p><p class="article__body-text">The Biden administration at first sought an agreement that would be “longer and stronger” than the original. Iran, arguing that America had to atone for reneging on the <small>JCPOA</small>, has also demanded better terms, not least that America should move first by lifting all Trump-era sanctions.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such a more-for-more deal seems beyond reach. The likeliest option is what Mr Blinken calls “a mutual return to compliance with the <small>JCPOA</small>”. But that is losing its appeal, too. Even if stocks of highly enriched uranium are shipped out of Iran and centrifuges are dismantled, Iran has acquired valuable know-how that cannot be unlearnt. Mr Albright thinks the <small>JCPOA</small> can no longer restore the one-year breakout time. Moreover, the sunset clauses mean that Iran would be allowed to expand its enrichment programme in 2025.</p><p class="article__body-text">Although the Biden administration does not intend to submit any agreement with Iran for congressional approval (just as the Obama administration skirted Congress with the <small>JCPOA</small>), hawkish congressmen are trying to find ways to oblige it to do so. Mr Biden will be hoping that some opponents, having seen the dangerous consequences of an unconstrained Iran, will support a deal. Under Mr Bennett, Israel has acquiesced to the talks for now; some Israeli officials see merit in the <small>JCPOA</small>. But some are privately expressing dismay about the apparent lack of an American Plan <small>B</small>, including military options. One idea floated by Israel is a strategy of “death by a thousand cuts”—conducting many small military and diplomatic actions, short of open air strikes.</p><p class="article__body-text">Jim Risch, a Republican senator, warns Mr Biden that a revived <small>JCPOA</small> is bound to be repudiated by a future Republican president. His answer? Tighten the economic noose and prepare for the worst. “If the Iranians get close to getting nuclear weapons, this administration needs to think: what are they going to do when they get the call from the Israelis?” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "The final countdown"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20new%20crisis%20between%20America%20and%20Iran%20looms&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-12&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frkth5mnbt9c878qmouebtm95jf2gafm1&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
