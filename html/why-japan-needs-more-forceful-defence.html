That suited locals, a laid-back, heavy-drinking bunch—until recently. China’s rise has made many wary. “Look at what’s happening in Hong Kong,” frets Itokazu Kenichi, the island’s mayor. There is also “a sense that America is in decline”, says Tasato Chiyoki, a councillor. As Japan’s westernmost territory, such worries are no abstraction: on a clear day, Taiwan looms a mere 111km away.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/why-japan-needs-more-forceful-defence.mp3" title="Why Japan needs more forceful defence"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Japan’s Self-Defence Forces (<small>SDF</small>), as its army is called, opened a small outpost on Yonaguni in 2016. It faced resistance, but opposition has since faded. Earlier this year, local voters elected Mr Itokazu, an advocate of expanding the military presence. Even some who were against have changed their tune. “I don’t think China will invade,” Mr Tasato says. “But with the current situation, you never know.” Now he would like his government to plan for refugees who might flee Taiwan in a conflict.</p><p class="article__body-text">If rivalry between China and America is the big story in 21st century geopolitics, no other country, except perhaps Taiwan itself, has as much influence as Japan over how it will unfold—nor as much to lose if it goes badly. “Japan is the front line,” says General Yoshida Yoshihide, chief of the army. This reality is forcing a realisation that, although there can be no substitute for America, Japan must supplement it in order to maintain a favourable balance of power.</p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/680/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211211_SRC270.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211211_SRC270.png" srcset="../image/20211211_SRC270.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Japan is strengthening defences and building ties with others. Tanaka Akihiko, of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (<small>GRIPS</small>) in Tokyo, speaks of a shift from a “one-pillar” to a “multi-pillar” architecture. “We can’t rely on America alone,” he says. That does not mean turning away but keeping America close by contributing more. Nor does it mean antagonising China, upon which the economy depends. “As the rest of us figure out how to compete with China without catastrophe, Japan has been there for at least a decade and Japan has the best strategy,” says Michael Green, a former official at America’s National Security Council.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Although this strategy coalesced under Mr Abe, it is the culmination of a long evolution. After the war Yoshida Shigeru, a former prime minister, said Japan should shelter under the American security umbrella and focus on reviving its economy. Others, such as Kishi Nobusuke, Mr Abe’s grandfather, wanted to ditch the strictures of the American-imposed constitution and re-establish Japan as a military power. The Yoshida doctrine won. For decades, Japanese foreign policy was limited to economics.</p><p class="article__body-text">The first inklings of change came under Nakasone Yasuhiro in the 1980s. But the big turning-point was the first Gulf war. “Even Honduras went there with a stick,” says Kanehara Nobukatsu, a later deputy national security adviser under Mr Abe. “Japan sat on the couch and sent a cheque—that was our reputation.” When the Kuwaitis took out an advertisement in American newspapers to thank the coalition, Japan was left off the list, prompting policymakers to rethink its role, says Iokibe Makoto, a historian of diplomacy. The shift coincided with the rise of a generation of revisionist leaders.</p><h2>The China threat</h2><p class="article__body-text">China’s aggression has been a catalyst, especially in clashes over the disputed Senkaku Islands in 2010, when it banned exports of rare earths to Japan. “We had been in a greenhouse,” says Miyake Kunihiko, a former diplomat. “China was kind enough to break the windows—the cold wind came in and we woke up.” America’s ambivalence to Asia has made Japanese leaders fear abandonment; Donald Trump’s erratic behaviour led some to speak of going nuclear (an option that remains unlikely). Officials welcome Joe Biden’s focus on Asia, but worry about the absence of American trade policy and a tendency to frame the contest with China in ideological terms. In Mr Biden’s talk of a “foreign policy for the American middle class”, many hear echoes of “America First”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">That has increased the urgency to do more at home. To Mr Abe’s chagrin, Article Nine of the constitution, which forbids “land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential”, stands. In practice, it matters less than it did, owing to changes in the laws governing the <small>SDF</small> passed in 2014 and 2015. In the past, it could use force only in response to a direct attack. The new framework allows it if the Diet deems a situation an “existential threat”. “Some people focus on the limits,” says Richard Samuels, a security expert at <small>MIT</small>. “But those are pretty flexible limits: an existential threat is what you call an existential threat.”</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1217/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211211_SRM938.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211211_SRM938.png" srcset="../image/20211211_SRM938.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">One result of the new laws is more space to plan realistically. During the cold war, Japan and America had a combined operations plan for what to do in a conflict with the Soviet Union, but it was largely worthless because it considered only a scenario in which the Soviet Union invaded Japan alone, says Michishita Narushige, also of <small>GRIPS.</small> “The constitutional limit really distorted the scenario,” he says. No longer. Discussions about a clash with China are under way. Japanese and American officials talk a lot about Taiwan. In April Mr Biden and Mr Suga, then prime minister, mentioned “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, the first such reference since 1969.</p><p class="article__body-text">Behind closed doors, consultations focus on two types of contingency. First is an invasion of Taiwan, probably involving Chinese attacks on American bases in Japan and perhaps an attempt to seize Japanese islands. But senior officials worry more about a second, less clear-cut situation, such as a blockade of Taiwan, or occupation of its outer-lying islands. There is no consensus about Japan’s red lines (nor an understanding of America’s). A Japanese leader now has the tools to act, but needs a political decision to use them. Officials fret that the public does not share their sense of urgency, and might recoil against using force. The <small>LDP</small> is in coalition with Komeito, a pacifist party with close ties to China. Issues between China and Taiwan “need to be resolved through those parties”, says Yamaguchi Natsuo, Komeito’s leader.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>SDF</small> has been moving resources from Hokkaido towards the south-west. A host of new bases have appeared in the Nansei Islands, which spread some 1,200km from Okinawa to Yonaguni. The army has created a force for recapturing islands modelled on America’s Marine Corps. At the base of this new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade on Kyushu, soldiers train to swim with 45kg packs and practise escaping from capsized troop carriers. “It’s different from the cold-war period,” says General Hirata Takanori, the brigade’s commander. “We are the first responders now.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The shift is a work in progress. “This is not enough firepower,” admits General Yoshida. Defence spending has grown since 2010, but not at the pace of China’s (or even South Korea’s). The <small>SDF</small> is often like a football team practising without a ball. On Amami-Oshima, the site of a new missile base, drills stop before the firing begins; to practise shooting missiles, troops must travel to America. Decision-making is still too slow. By the time Japan got planes to Afghanistan to evacuate personnel after America’s withdrawal, almost nobody was left to be picked up.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Yet “Japanese capability is not inconsequential”, says Sheila Smith, author of “Japan Rearmed”. The submarine fleet has grown from 16 to 22, making a difference to Chinese planning. Last year Japan and Australia agreed to let their forces operate in each other’s territory—the first such pact with a country other than America. Negotiations over a similar deal with Britain began after the recent visit of the aircraft-carrier <em>Queen Elizabeth</em>. Warships from Germany and the Netherlands also called by this year, and French forces joined Japanese-American exercises for the first time. Co-operation with India has blossomed through the Quad club. “The fact that India is active in the Quad—a lot of that has to do with Japan,” says C. Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign-affairs expert.</p><p class="article__body-text">Japan has played a similar role in South-East Asia. “Of all the <small>ASEAN</small> dialogue partners, Japan understands <small>ASEAN</small> the best,” says Bilahari Kausikan, a former senior Singaporean diplomat. Though China’s Belt and Road Initiative has attracted more attention, Japanese companies and government agencies have quietly worked to build a big stock of investment in <small>ASEAN</small>’s infrastructure. Those in the region have noticed: polls show Japan is the most trusted big power among South-East Asians.</p><p class="article__body-text">That is not true in South Korea. In 2015 the two agreed that Japan should apologise and pay compensation to Koreans held as sex slaves by its imperial armed forces, but South Korea later backed off that pact. There is plenty of blame for poor relations all round. Yet in South-East Asia “the second world war is a non-issue”, says Mr Kausikan. It sometimes helps that Japan does not press too hard on human rights, an approach equal parts strategic and self-serving. For some, Japan seems a more reliable partner than America. “Americans only talk,” says Mr Mohan. “The Japanese are the ones who built it all—they have the experience, money and political skill to move things in the region.”</p><p class="article__body-text">From Japan’s perspective, America’s approach to South-East Asia is too inflexible. The Americans avoid state-owned enterprises, but in much of Asia, it is hard to find purely private-sector projects, says Maeda Tadashi, governor of the Japan Bank for International Co-operation. Emphasising competition between democracy and authoritarianism impedes closer co-operation with countries such as Vietnam, a communist dictatorship that has an important strategic role. Demanding allegiance to cold-war-style blocs is anathema to many. “They don’t like to be forced to choose between China or America,” says Kitaoka Shinichi, president of the Japan International Co-operation Agency.</p><p class="article__body-text">Nor, for that matter, does Japanese business. “I do not want to be on the <small>US</small> side,” says Mr Yanai. “I do not want to be on China’s side either.” China accounted for 22% of Japan’s exports in 2020, while America took 18.4%. That has informed the government’s approach to decoupling, which is decidedly selective. Mr Amari, who has spearheaded economic-security policy, says Japan’s focus is on reducing risks from “choke-points”, such as medical equipment and semiconductors. <small>TSMC</small>, a big Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer, was lured this year with big subsidies to build a foundry in Japan.</p><p class="article__body-text">More sensitive industries are girding for further divisions. Nakajima Norio, boss of Murata, a manufacturer of high-end electronic components that once counted both Apple and Huawei as big customers, reckons the worst case may mean developing separate supply chains or even separate legal entities to work for clients on both sides. Less sensitive industries continue to press ahead. Mr Yanai’s Uniqlo has just opened a flagship store in Beijing and plans to build 100 new stores in China every year.</p><p class="article__body-text">Japan can teach America lessons on “how you diminish some vulnerabilities, while still not talking about wholesale decoupling”, says Mireya Solis of the Brookings Institution think-tank. America might try to learn from Japan on trade policy as well. Where Japan was once a laggard, it has undergone a dramatic evolution since deciding to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (<small>TPP</small>) in 2011, and ultimately rescuing it when America under Mr Trump pulled out in 2017. “We saw Japan transform from rule-taker—doing what it was pressured to do—to rule-maker,” says Wendy Cutler, a former deputy United States trade representative.</p><p class="article__body-text">Japan’s new leadership in the region is facing its first real test with duelling bids from China and Taiwan to join what is now the <small>CPTPP</small>. It is indicative of the trials that await in the Reiwa era. The delicate balancing act with China—deterring but not provoking, enjoying the fruits of its market while denouncing the ills of its politics—will be harder to sustain. Officials reckon that Xi Jinping has not yet decided what to do with Japan. But they worry that may change, especially if China’s economy stalls. Japan remains an ideal target for nationalist passions: in China, memories of its wartime atrocities are still potent.</p><p class="article__body-text">However, Japan’s new activism abroad will also be significantly constrained by its own domestic limitations. It has chosen to become more proactive internationally at a time when its relative economic strength is slipping. Its economy is still the world’s third-largest. But the trajectory will force difficult choices about priorities. Back on Yonaguni, China is not the only potential disaster on Mr Itokazu’s mind. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div class="ds-chapter-list"><h2 class="ds-section-headline"><a class="ds-section-headline-link" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-12-11">Japan</a> <span class="ds-section-subheadline">On the front line</span></h2><ul><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/a-country-that-is-on-the-front-line"><span>A country that is on the front line</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor ds-link-with-arrow--selected" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/why-japan-needs-more-forceful-defence"><span>Why Japan needs more forceful defence</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/japan-has-a-chequered-record-on-climate-change"><span>Japan has a chequered record on climate change</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/the-big-city-that-is-also-pleasant-to-live-in"><span>The big city that is also pleasant to live in</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/an-ageing-country-shows-others-how-to-manage"><span>An ageing country shows others how to manage</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/japans-economy-is-stronger-than-many-realise"><span>Japan’s economy is stronger than many realise</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/letting-more-migrants-in-by-stealth"><span>Letting more migrants in by stealth</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/12/07/the-future-could-be-brighter"><span>The future could be brighter</span></a></li></ul></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline "Into the world"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Why%20Japan%20needs%20more%20forceful%20defence&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-07&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F5bi9mnjtoaacrha25rhv49s6vbnhp7ku&amp;type=SR&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
