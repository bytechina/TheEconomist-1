The English translation was made by </i>The Economist<i> and has been lightly edited for clarity. The Spanish transcript is <a href="./como-gustavo-petro-cambiaria-a-colombia-si-gana-las-elecciones.html">available here.</a></i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>The Economist:</b> How do you plan to finance all your proposals? You want to expand the size of the state while prohibiting new oil and gas exploration, though hydrocarbons make up half of Colombia’s exports. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Gustavo Petro: </b>Firstly, revenues from oil and coal have been declining. And in reality we are subsidising coal—it’s not a source of revenue for Colombia, it’s an expense. We subsidise the production of coal because of contracts signed long ago with the Cerrejón Mine [a large open-pit coal mine]. So that’s not where the problem lies. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The problem is in the fiscal deficit we have today, which is the highest in Colombia’s history. And it’s due in part to the fall in the international price of oil and coal, which will continue in the future—because demand for oil and coal will continue to fall. </p><p class="article__body-text">Combined with the covid-19 pandemic and the policies implemented to confront it, which the government of [Iván] Duque took out more debt to pay for, this increased the fiscal deficit to close to 80trn pesos ($20bn), when the national budget is 350trn pesos ($88bn), meaning some 8% of GDP. </p><p class="article__body-text">So the question is: how, if there is a deficit of that size, can we increase social spending? So the first thing I would respond to you is that we have to reduce the fiscal deficit. And the way to do that is through a tax reform, which we have discussed publicly, we are not hiding the need to increase some taxes and remove a series of tax exemptions. </p><p class="article__body-text">The first reform would precisely be to remove subsidies from hydrocarbons, specifically coal. And in relation to oil, we would turn into law that the payment of royalties—which is the income that the Colombian state receives from the exploitation of oil for being the owner of the [mineral rights]—should no longer be deducted from the income tax paid by oil and coal companies. That was the norm before, it could not be deducted: an oil company made its profits, paid an income tax on the profits, and paid royalties that were generally given to the state. That rule changed and the royalty is deducted from the income tax, that is to say, no royalties are paid. This was a judicial decision from the council of the state about three years ago. The loss for the treasury from royalties payments, depending on the international price of oil, ranges from between 10trn and 20trn pesos ($2bn-5bn) a year.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>But would you end oil and gas exploration entirely from day one? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>That’s a different question. </p><p class="article__body-text">I’m saying that royalties are no longer going to be deducted from income tax which means that oil company profits are going to continue, right? That’s the logic. What I’m talking about is the tax reform. The tax reform has in some part to do with hydrocarbons, which is the country’s main source of foreign currency. That would already significantly reduce Colombia’s fiscal deficit. </p><p class="article__body-text">But there is also another series of tax measures that have to be taken to reduce the fiscal deficit. If you add the tax on dividends, which in Colombia is not levied, unlike in most countries in the world, the tax on dividends would significantly reduce Colombia’s fiscal deficit. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> How high would this tax be? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> Like income tax, it would increase as the company’s income increases until reaching 30%. The dividend, which is the income received by the owner of the company for taking the money out of the company’s profits, ie, for not reinvesting it, is currently not taxed. We want it to be taxed according to the size of the dividend, following the same scale that already exists for personal income taxes. </p><p class="article__body-text">So now I answered your first question. So the tax reform would reduce the fiscal deficit. But the idea we propose is that for every two pesos we save, one goes towards reducing the fiscal deficit, and the other would go towards financing new social expenditure. That’s how we plan to pay for new spending. </p><p class="article__body-text">Now we can move onto your next question about hydrocarbons. And it’s about the Colombian economic model in general: since abandoning a coffee-based economy 30 years ago, Colombia’s economy has depended on exports of oil, coal, and cocaine. </p><p class="article__body-text">At its best moment, coffee exports reached $6.5bn a year. And these three products—oil, coal, and cocaine—managed to bring in $65bn a year in 2013. So ten times more money. But if we look at how much employment is generated, the coffee industry employed more than 2m people. The oil and coal industry only employs 150,000 people. So we have swapped dollars for jobs. </p><p class="article__body-text">We have generated a kind of Dutch disease [where fossil-fuel exports push up the value of the local currency and render other, more labour-intensive industries uncompetitive]. Those $65bn of annual exports of those three products have been spent on imports, generally on products that used to be grown inside the country. And the consequence has been the destruction of domestic production. </p><p class="article__body-text">Oil and coal are not sustainable for an economy in the long term, and cocaine even less so. So Colombia needs to diversify its economic system towards a completely different model, in a transition. And my government programme suggests that this transition should be towards an economy based on agricultural production, industry and tourism. So from an economy based on extraction to one based on production. </p><p class="article__body-text">And one of the things I am proposing is to prohibit new hydrocarbon exploration contracts. This means maintaining all the current signed contracts and oil exploration projects—but we will not sign new oil exploration concessions. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Let’s talk about the independence of the central bank, which has been important to attracting foreign investment. Do you want to change it? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> I haven’t said I want to change it. I don’t know where that comes from. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>So what does it mean that you want to put “sectors close to society” on the board of directors? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> It means complying with the 1991 constitution. The president is allowed to appoint some members of the board during their term. And that is what I will do when it is my turn to appoint new board members. I will appoint two members from civil society. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Do you think the Central Bank is currently independent? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>The board of directors has been chosen by a single government, really…which is that of Álvaro Uribe Velez [<i>a right-wing president who ruled from 2002 to 2008. He had the constitution changed in 2004 to allow him to run for re-election. Presidential re-election was banned by Congress in 2015</i>]. When re-election was established, without changing the rules on the appointment of Central Bank members, that granted him a lot of power to choose the majority of the Bank’s board of directors. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Have you been speaking to business leaders, and if so, what assurances have you given them that Colombia will still have a stable business climate? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>Well I’ve been doing things like this, explaining the reality of my programme. The thing is that in Colombia, like in other countries, the counter-campaigns, in this case against me, have created false narratives. So the caricature about my programme has been that we will expropriate businesses, as if we wanted to create a Soviet economy.</p><p class="article__body-text">I have never suggested that, not even in my days as a guerrilla. My insurgent movement [the M-19] was part of the process of rewriting the constitution of 1991. And the idea we proposed in that constitution, which is still in force and which I want to fulfil, is to create a social democratic market economy—as the Germans call it. With universal rights and respect for private property as well as free enterprise. But always taking into account social responsibility. And, above all, the democratisation of the conditions of production in the hands of the whole of society.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Can you tell us about the taxes you want to increase on the 4,000 richest people in Colombia?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>Well it fits in perfectly. Colombia has one of the greatest social inequalities in the world and our tax system doesn’t reduce that inequality, unlike what happens in Europe. So our tax reform wants to complete three objectives: reduce the deficit, stimulate production, and increase social justice, tax justice. </p><p class="article__body-text">How can we increase production while also increasing tax justice? By placing the highest tax burden on the wealthiest and least productive parts of society. For example, tax on presumptive income from money hoarded in tax havens. Or taxes on large fertile agricultural estates that are not productive. Or the tax on dividends, because that’s money you extract from production. And those would be the three principal taxes. If we manage to also reform the royalties tax, with these reforms altogether we would have an increase in the tax take of 40trn-50trn pesos a year ($10bn-12bn). If you translate those taxes onto people, you’re only really affecting 4,000 individuals and companies (and the only businesses that would be affected would be the hydrocarbon ones). </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Do you not fear that rich people will leave the country for Miami and move their money outside? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> They would pay higher taxes in the United States than here. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Talking about the US, what is going to be your foreign policy, how are you going to renegotiate the free-trade deal with the US?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> After winning the presidency we will propose a dialogue with [President Joe] Biden’s government to construct a new bilateral agenda, whose primary focus will be about fighting the climate crisis. Because in America—in our concept of the Americas which goes from Alaska to Patagonia—the country that produces the most greenhouse gas emissions is the United States, and the largest sponge that absorbs those emissions is the Amazon rainforest. They emit, and we have the sponge. And that needs a dialogue because if the Amazon rainforest is destroyed, as is already under way, humanity will suffer. So I believe that has to be the main point of any bilateral discussion with the United States, and currently it does not even feature.</p><p class="article__body-text">The second point has to do with the anti-drugs policy, which has been the traditional focus [of our bilateral relationship]. After 40 years of the war on drugs, we have to announce its failure. Every year 60,000-70,000 people in the United States die from drug overdoses, which are not caused by cocaine, which kills 3,000 people, or marijuana, which kills no one. Meaning, the damage from consuming drugs in the US has grown with the use of synthetic drugs, mostly opioids. Meanwhile, over the same period, 1m people in Latin America have died [because of the war on drugs]. So we’ve had 1m people die in Latin America and a jump in mortality related to drug consumption in the US. And on top of that, Colombia is exporting more cocaine today than ever before. The owners of those drugs are Mexican cartels, which are many times more powerful than Pablo Escobar ever was. So the balance of the war on drugs has been a total failure. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Because of that we have to evaluate the policy based on the facts and take a new path towards more efficient policies. If you look at the Colombian drug trade it went from being non-existent 40 years ago to flourishing in urban areas where industries declined—particularly Medellín’s textiles industry, which was very important. And where the agriculture industry was destroyed, narco-trafficking groups took over the countryside. </p><p class="article__body-text">So a new anti-drug policy should have as its first objective to rebuild Colombian agriculture and industry. And the second objective should be to take territorial control away from the mafias. Meaning, turning populations that today are under the rule of criminal organisations into allies of the State. We have identified three groups: peasant cultivators of coca leaf; drug consumers; and the popular economy, meaning people who are dependent on basically loan sharks, usurious loans, which come from criminal organisations. </p><p class="article__body-text">So this means doing an agrarian reform. And with that agrarian reform, a new public health policy towards drug consumption. And the creation of a system of public and cooperative credit for the popular economy, which represents half of Colombia’s economy. All this would weaken Colombia’s criminal organisations because we would remove their political power. </p><p class="article__body-text">From this point of view, the free-trade deal with the US needs to be re-examined. Does it help to increase narco-trafficking, or does it help to increase agricultural and industrial production? In my opinion, and I’ve said this to many Democratic Representatives in their congressional offices, that the free-trade agreement with the US ends up strengthening narco-trafficking in Colombia. </p><p class="article__body-text">And that, to put it in concrete terms: the US wins because they export 6m tonnes of corn to Colombia, which destroys our domestic agrarian production and forces peasants to cultivate more coca leaf, and then the mafias export more cocaine. So in exchange for exports of corn, they get more imports of cocaine. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Senator Iván Marulanda has suggested regulating part of the cocaine market here. President Pedro Castillo in Peru is also talking about doing this. Is that something you would support?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> The legalisation of marijuana is a reality today and Colombia should take advantage of that. But it happened first in the US. The same would have to happen with cocaine. If the US does not legalise cocaine, we wouldn’t be able to do anything in Colombia. It would just be a utopian idea. </p><p class="article__body-text">So what we have to look at with respect to the cocaine mafias—which have transformed into multi-crime organisations, meaning they don’t just export cocaine, instead they perpetrate crimes against humanity on Colombian territory—with extended links to political power and inside the [Colombian] state. </p><p class="article__body-text">These criminal organisations grow because of the prohibition that exists in the United States. While that prohibition is maintained, they will keep growing. Unless we have an alternative policy that is about removing their political power inside Colombia. And that is the strategy I am proposing for the country. </p><p class="article__body-text">I know that we won’t be able to end narco-trafficking as long as prohibition exists. Because prohibition generates extraordinary profits. </p><p class="article__body-text">But we can weaken these criminal organisations through the democratisation of Colombian society and the creation of a strong economy based on production. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Rodolfo Hernández is rising in the polls. Would you work with him or with Sergio Fajardo or with any of the other presidential candidates?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> We have invited Fajardo since the 2018 elections to have a political dialogue with us, and establish through a popular consultation who would be the candidate. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>But representatives from your coalition have always spoken of “burning” his campaign. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>No, that’s just political jargon we use here in Colombia. We use the word “burn” when someone doesn’t reach the number of votes needed to be elected. I myself say that I “burned” in my 1994 campaign for the Senate. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Beyond the use of that word there is a perception that you have attacked his campaign. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>Those are the controversies of campaigning. </p><p class="article__body-text">To Hernández we have proposed the same thing [dialogue]. But if he passes to the second round it won’t be possible. And if I win in the first round it will also not be possible. But there are the political processes we are going through. Effectively, Hernández was more capable than Fajardo in competing [with me]. And now he competes with Uribismo for second place. And Uribismo could transfer its votes to whoever is in second place against me in order to try to stop me from implementing my political reforms. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> In this campaign you have made alliances with former figures from Uribista parties, like Roy Barreras and Armando Benedetti. You have also made alliances with evangelical Christian figures. So there seem to be two Petros: the one who fought the establishment as mayor of Bogotá, and the one who is making alliances with traditional politicians. Which Petro would govern? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> We are not making alliances with anybody and everybody. For us it’s clear who our rival is: social, economic and political. So we are not playing around. We are isolating our rivals. Because the establishment is divided. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> So you would make alliances with some within [the traditional parties]?</p><p class="article__body-text">[We will make alliances] depending on whether we can do the reforms that we believe are fundamental to constructing peace in this country, and which are evidently of a social nature. </p><p class="article__body-text">The majority of Colombian society has been Uribista this century. The century has been dominated by Uribismo. Now, if I manage to win a majority, as the polls suggest, it will be because part of the electorate that used to vote for Uribe now trusts more in us. That is to say, part of the popular base of Uribismo has become progressive. </p><p class="article__body-text">Because the economic and political model on which Uribisimo sustained itself has fallen apart. On the economic side, that was oil, gas and cocaine. And on the political side, the destruction of the FARC [the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, a Marxist guerrilla group that fought the Colombian state from 1964 to 2016] provided a unifying narrative, but now they do not exist anymore. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Which other Latin American leaders do you see yourself aligned with? And do you still admire Hugo Chávez?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>We have [President] Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador in government [in Mexico]. And we also have the government of [President Gabriel] Boric in Chile. And it’s probable that Lula [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva] will win in Brazil. If I manage to win in Colombia, that will create a new progressive partnership in Latin America. </p><p class="article__body-text">And I want that partnership to focus on the fight against climate change in the world. Which would oblige Latin America to abandon the strategy of distributing wealth on the basis of non-renewable fossil fuel resources. This is what I believe explains the failure of the previous wave of progressivism, which Hugo Chávez was a part of. So I am proposing something very different from what Hugo Chávez did. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE</b>: So you don’t admire Chávez anymore? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> Hugo Chávez is part of Latin America’s history. And he’s part of a specific phase of Latin American history that has to do with the construction of social justice on the basis of hydrocarbons. Which is very similar in some senses to attempts made in some Middle Eastern countries in previous decades. All of those projects failed. Because the construction of a democratic society in which the most excluded people can exercise their rights and be empowered cannot be built on such a flimsy basis as the fossil fuel economy. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>You want to re-establish diplomatic ties with Venezuela. What do you think of the Maduro regime, which is autocratic, and why do you think Colombia needs to re-establish those ties with Venezuela? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>Maduro’s regime is dictatorial. But the Europeans have taught us very well that they could live side by side after the Second World War without killing each other through deeper commercial ties, independent of the regimes that are in power in one country or another.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-5"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">When you forget that lesson, war breaks out. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> You have received death threats. Where are those death threats coming from, and where would they come from if you were to lose? </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>We don’t pay that much attention to the explicit death threats. Death threats have become the norm in Colombia and thousands are made every day. The Black Eagles, an organisation which doesn’t exist in practice, publishes statements which are publicised from the north to the south of the country. That signifies that their source of power comes from within the state. </p><p class="article__body-text">Instead, we pay careful attention to where threats are not issued. And there we have found that there are operations underway. And through information that reaches us through our sympathisers, who overhear conversations, we learn about possible threats and investigate them. </p><p class="article__body-text">When there are explicit death threats, it’s because they won’t kill. To know if an operation is actually underway, we find that out through information that people pass on to us. And we have uncovered several operations like that. They always come from the nexus that exists in Colombia between crime and politics—meaning the traditional political powers in Colombia have a strong relationship with the multi-criminal organisations. So those who commit the assassination attempts are sicarios (hired killers), they are members of gangs. But those who produce them, who finance them, generally come from centres of political power. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>And if you lose the election, would you call people to the streets?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP:</b> If they don’t steal the elections, no. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Would it be legitimate if Federico Gutiérrez wins?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>GP: </b>But how could he win? We just had legislative elections on the 13th of March where they tried to take 700,000 votes away from us out of 3m votes cast for our Senate list. That is not acceptable. We discovered the fraud and recovered four seats in the Senate. So, if anyone wins legitimately, we will recognise the results. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Many thanks for your time. </p></div></body></html>
