The skit was memorable for its absurdity but it did not do much to explain "The Niño". It aired during the devastating 1997–98 El Niño, which caused at least $35 billion in destruction and 23,000 deaths globally. The 2015–16 El Niño was even bigger, according to analysis of satellite pictures by NASA, America’s space agency. So what is El Niño?</p><p class="article__body-text">Spanish for “little boy”, El Niño was so named by Peruvian fishermen in the 17th century in honour of the Christ child. They observed that every few years, around Christmas time, the Pacific grew warmer and fish vanished, migrating to cooler waters. Unlike hurricanes, El Niño is not an individual weather event: it is a climate pattern. In non-Niño years trade winds, which blow east to west, push warm equatorial water into the western Pacific, allowing cold water from the deep ocean to well up in the eastern Pacific. During a Niño, those winds slacken. The warm water that is normally pushed westward pools right across the Pacific Ocean. Water temperature increases, and heat and moisture rise into the atmosphere, altering wind and storm patterns. If ocean-surface temperatures are between 0.5 and 1°C above average during a three-month window, America’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) deems it a Niño.</p></div></body></html>
