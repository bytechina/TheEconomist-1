Her apartment was stacked full of cardboard boxes, and three hard-shell suitcases were wedged between the dining table and wall, price tags still dangling from their handles. She was not excited about leaving Hong Kong for Britain. Two years earlier, she and her husband had taken their sons on a reconnaissance trip, staying for a few days with old friends in London to see if they liked it. She had not.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/does-good-parenting-in-hong-kong-mean-submitting-to-the-party.mp3" title="Does good parenting in Hong Kong mean submitting to the Party?"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">It was her son cheering for China during the Tokyo Olympics in the summer of 2021 that tipped her over the edge. That, and being forced to sign an oath pledging fealty to the Hong Kong government and, effectively, the Chinese Communist Party. Never mind that she had worked in the civil service for almost 20 years without ever having to take an oath.</p><p class="article__body-text">To make matters worse, a culture of informing on colleagues had enveloped her workplace, and a record number of people had resigned. Mrs Choi was not a democracy activist. But the speed with which Hong Kong had slid from being a fairly liberal and free society towards an authoritarian one shocked her. She and her husband had stopped talking about politics at home, fearful that their sons, who were seven and ten, might overhear them and unknowingly say the wrong thing in school.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mrs Choi thought about how nervous, worried and excited her sons were about moving, emotions that whirled inside her too. Would they fit in? What would she do if her sons were bullied at school? What if her sons never learned to read Chinese fluently? What if they refused to answer her in Cantonese?</p><p class="article__body-text">She helped run a picture-book club for her sons and other children in the neighbourhood, and hundreds of such books filled several of her boxes. Some were by Hong Kong or Taiwanese authors, but most were Chinese translations of books from around the world. Her sons loved the Butt Detective and Sherlock Holmes series, but she also read them books about democracy. One favourite, popular among other parents in Hong Kong, was “The President of the Jungle”. In it, the animals are fed up with King Lion, who cares only about himself. So they hold an election and Snake, Sloth and Monkey decide to run against Lion. To keep the family’s memories of Hong Kong alive, Mrs Choi planned to start a Cantonese picture-book group in Britain.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mrs Choi did not hate China, nor did she want her boys to do so. But, she said, “I don’t want them to grow up being forced at school to love the Communist Party.” And the indoctrination had started. New multiple-choice exam questions in primary school asked students “How do you feel about China?” The only options were positive. In a government video for primary-school pupils, an animated owl wearing glasses and a graduation cap warned them about threats such as terrorism and hostile foreign powers.</p><p class="article__body-text">A struggle is under way for the hearts and minds of Hong Kong’s children. The city’s chief secretary said in 2020, when he was its security secretary, that the government’s foremost target was education: “The main task is to cleanse it of ‘bad apples’ to save the students from being poisoned.” Teachers are leaving at around twice the normal rate. According to a survey by the largest teachers’ union in Hong Kong, over 40% of teachers said they wanted to quit the profession. Of those, 70% cited “increased political pressure” as the main reason. Many teachers know all too well how successfully China ramped up “patriotic education” in mainland schools after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mrs Choi felt lucky. Her husband’s company had offered to transfer him to London, and they both had siblings who could look after their elderly parents in Hong Kong. The future is darker for many of their friends and other parents who have chosen to stay, whether because of family ties, the cost of moving, or their attachment to Hong Kong. Some hope the Chinese crackdown will not be that bad; others, more pessimistic, are still determined to raise their children with ideas the regime considers so dangerous they are punishable with life in prison. It is a risky choice. About 4,000 of the more than 10,000 people arrested since pro-democracy protests roiled the city in 2019 are high-school and university students. Authors of pro-democracy picture books have also been jailed, charged with printing seditious material.</p><h2>Illiberal arts</h2><p class="article__body-text">Since the protests, Hong Kong’s largest teachers’ union has been forced to close, and the education bureau has overhauled the curriculum. Liberal studies, a compulsory high-school subject that encouraged students to think critically, including about China, has been abolished, replaced by a course emphasising China’s achievements. “In traditional Chinese culture, teachers are supposed to be role models,” says one liberal-studies teacher, Jason Wong. “How do I encourage my students to think critically while teaching them to obey authority and be loyal to the motherland?”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“Now you are rewarded for perpetuating the lies of the Communist Party”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">In the end, Mr Wong instructed his students to praise the government in their exams. “I think teachers and parents in Hong Kong are now struggling with the same question: how do we teach our children?” he says. “If I teach my students to be sincere, kind and honest—important qualities for being a good human being—then it is difficult to survive in this society. Now you are rewarded for perpetuating the lies of the Communist Party.” Mr Wong is applying for a licence to work as a taxi driver.</p><p class="article__body-text">Hong Kong’s world-class universities are under scrutiny, too. Ip Iam-Chong, a professor of cultural studies, was denied tenure despite backing from his department, he believes because of his outspoken support of democracy. But he, his wife and their eight-year-old daughter are staying put. They love Hong Kong and are attached to friends who share similar values. “My daughter can leave to study or live overseas when she is older,” he says.</p><p class="article__body-text">He tells her stories, including about his friends and students who are in jail. His best friend is Eddie Chu, a former pro-democracy politician who has been charged with subversion for taking part in a primary election. He faces life in prison. “I tell her about what happened to Eddie, why the police have put him in jail, whether there is a reason and why people are migrating. I think it is enough to just tell her these stories. How she understands the situation isn’t something that we as parents can dictate.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Other parents are more supportive of the government. During the protests in 2019, Catherine Lau bought her son a set of Hong Kong police-force toys from Taobao, a Chinese e-commerce site: police dogs, officers firing tear-gas and police officers holding up signs warning against illegal assembly. But Ms Lau cancelled all play dates, concerned about what conversations the toys might provoke: “I wouldn’t have known what to say to the other mum. We don’t talk about politics; it is too sensitive.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Ada Mak, who runs a nursery in southern Hong Kong, is on a mission to instil a love of the motherland in her pupils. On the eve of important holidays in China, the nursery transforms into the stage of a flag-raising ceremony. A few chosen students don white gloves tailored to their tiny hands. They march behind a boy who holds a small flag in his outstretched arms. The students stand to attention. The flag is unfurled and raised on a little pole. Loudspeakers blast the national anthem: “China has arrived at its most dangerous moment. Everyone must let out one last roar.”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Many in Hong Kong fear the next generation will be like the post-Tiananmen generation in mainland China</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Some parents do not approve of these ceremonies, Mrs Mak says. And most do not believe her when she tells them their children’s futures lie in mainland China. When Britain handed Hong Kong over to China, in 1997, the city’s economy was almost a fifth the size of the mainland’s. Now it is less than 2.5%.</p><p class="article__body-text">Once covid-19 restrictions lift and the border reopens between Hong Kong and neighbouring Shenzhen, Mrs Mak plans to take her parents to see how quickly China has developed. Shenzhen’s <small>GDP</small> overtook that of Hong Kong for the first time in 2018. “Around 20% of parents know this is true, 40% are in utter denial and the remaining 40% haven’t made up their minds. For the parents who disagree, I just ignore them. There is no point me wasting my time and energy trying to convince them. I’m focused on changing the minds of the parents in the middle. They need to get to grips with reality and start thinking about how to best prepare their kids for this future.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Within Hong Kong, the influence of the mainland is felt everywhere. Step out at lunchtime during the week and you are likely to hear conversations in Mandarin nearly as frequently as Cantonese, the dialect traditionally spoken in Hong Kong. Hong Kongers used to act as a bridge between China and the West. A few decades ago, many rushed to the mainland to set up factories or to run the Chinese branches of multinationals. Increasingly, these jobs are going to mainland Chinese who speak fluent English and have graduated from Ivy League universities or Oxbridge. Many companies want staff who not only speak the language of the clients they are pursuing but also watch the same films and gossip about the same celebrities.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Lau, who bought her son the police toys, works in financial technology. “I manage a lot of mainlanders who have moved to Hong Kong for work. They work harder, stay later and are more ambitious and thick-skinned. There is no way a local Hong Konger on my team can compete with them. The Hong Kong competitive advantage is gone.” She may not embrace the democracy movement, but she is not happy about the changes in the curriculum. “When I was growing up, we were taught to think at school. Now, it’s a joke.” She adds of her son, “Not only is he not going to learn about what really happened in Tiananmen Square, but he is also not going to be competitive against mainland Chinese his age when he enters the workforce.”</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/xmas-edition-images/XMD005.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">Hong Kong is one of 11 cities being merged into the Greater Bay Area, a signature plan of China’s president, Xi Jinping, which covers an area of nearly 90m people with an economy larger than Australia’s. Shenzhen is at the centre. Hong Kong’s primary role will be to provide Chinese companies with a way to raise money from abroad. Faced with this future, some wealthy Hong Kongers are sending their children to private schools which teach in Mandarin and English. “My children can pick up Cantonese on the street. I don’t care if they aren’t fluent,” says one Hong Kong father whose private-equity firm mostly invests in mainland China. He and his wife speak Mandarin at home.</p><p class="article__body-text">More and more high-school graduates from Hong Kong are choosing to attend university across the border. Tony Lam chose to study on the mainland because he has family there and tuition is about a quarter what it is in Hong Kong. He hopes to find a job in advertising or public relations when he graduates. “There are a lot more jobs in the mainland.” Mr Lam says the past two years of pandemic and protests have “proved the superiority of the mainland system”. Several of his friends who are also pursuing university in mainland China were encouraged by their parents to do so.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some parents reject the idea that the regime’s control is inevitable or, at least, permanent. Rachel Leung is home schooling her daughter on a small farm because she wants her to have a connection to the land and to have time to play—and because she wants to insulate her from China’s influence. “The party will eventually fall,” she says. “When? I don’t know. Maybe 20 or 50 years from now. And when it does, what skills will our children, our grandchildren, need to thrive?” She pauses as children covered in mud from planting rice run by, then lists the qualities that she thinks they will need. “A willingness to communicate, the ability to persuade and compromise, empathy and love, knowing how to listen deeply. There will be an end to this darkness. For now, we can’t do anything big. But we can do small things like raise our children with this future in mind.”</p><h2>Lessons learned</h2><p class="article__body-text">Ms Leung may be right. But the Chinese government has plenty of practice in moulding young minds. In 1989, at the height of pro-democracy protests in China, hundreds of thousands of people piled into Tiananmen Square. Li Ming’s father was one of them. After the massacre, he made his way back to his home town to join the civil service. When the party rolled out its patriotic education campaign, Mr Li was one of tens of millions of students who were subjected to it.</p><p class="article__body-text">“My father taught me to never say anything in public that could get me into trouble,” he says. “He taught me, above everything else, to protect myself. It is a very pragmatic approach to life in China: it is the way to survive.” But his father also bought him whatever books he could find. He pushed Mr Li to think for himself by observing society and the people around them. When Mr Li moved to Hong Kong for university, his father warned him: “Be very careful what you say. But always remember: think for yourself.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Many in Hong Kong fear the next generation will be like the post-Tiananmen generation in mainland China. They expect the curriculum to change so much that the government’s campaign of indoctrination may succeed. Still, there are reasons Hong Kong may hold out. Because it is already advanced, the party’s deal with the mainland—of economic growth in exchange for political submission—does not apply. And so far, unlike in mainland China, the government has not restricted internet access.</p><p class="article__body-text">But the past two years in Hong Kong have shown how well the party understands power and how ruthlessly it will wield it. Mr Li may continue to think for himself, but he has absorbed the lesson his father drew from Tiananmen. He has returned home and is preparing for his civil-service examinations, with an eye to becoming a local propaganda official. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>Some names were changed to protect individuals featured in this story.</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ILLUSTRATIONS: TERRI PO</small></p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/christmas-style-fixes/index.html"></iframe></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Christmas Specials section of the print edition under the headline "Teach your children well"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Does%20good%20parenting%20in%20Hong%20Kong%20mean%20submitting%20to%20the%20Party%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F2tef7khtrh41r07o2nr9qan579m0uqj2&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
