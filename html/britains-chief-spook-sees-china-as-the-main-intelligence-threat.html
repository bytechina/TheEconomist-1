But times are changing. On November 30th Richard Moore, the spy agency’s boss, gave his first public speech since taking charge in October 2020. Russia and terrorism featured on his list of the “big four” priorities, as did the challenge from Iran’s revolutionary regime, which is moving steadily closer to being able to develop a nuclear weapon. But despite Russia’s alarming <a href="./21806546.html">military build-up around Ukraine</a> and a recent terrorist attack in Liverpool, China was his primary concern.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/britains-chief-spook-sees-china-as-the-main-intelligence-threat.mp3" title="Britain’s chief spook sees China as the main intelligence threat"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">“Adapting to a world affected by the rise of China is the single greatest priority for <small>MI</small>6,” declared Mr Moore. Such a pronouncement would have been unthinkable a decade ago, when David Cameron and George Osborne, his chancellor, were desperate to court Chinese trade and investment, and eager to play down the threat from the Communist Party’s hackers and intelligence officers.</p><p class="article__body-text">The political winds now blow from a different direction. A review of foreign policy in March concluded that China posed a “systemic challenge…to our security, prosperity and values”. In May Britain began ripping out Chinese-made Huawei kit from its 5 <small>G</small> mobile networks. It recently sent an aircraft-carrier to Asia, part of an eastward surge of warships. It is also increasing co-ordination on intelligence and military issues regarding China with its partners in the Five Eyes, a grouping that also includes America, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Moore, who joined <small>MI</small>6 during the cold war and spent much of his career in the Middle East, said that his service was also changing tack. “We are deepening our understanding of China across the <small>UK</small> intelligence community, and widening the options available to the government in managing the systemic challenges that it poses,” he said. Chinese spies are, he warned, “highly capable” and conducting “large-scale espionage”. They are monitoring and coercing the Chinese diaspora in Britain and using social media to “distort public discourse”.</p><p class="article__body-text">But Mr Moore’s most urgent warning related to science and technology. China, he said, was “expanding the web of authoritarian control around the planet” by exporting surveillance technology. That was not only a problem for recipients made vulnerable to Chinese coercion, but also for <small>MI</small>6 itself. “Our officers need to operate invisibly to our adversaries,” he noted. Chinese control of smartphones, apps and telecommunications networks, as well as access to vast repositories of personal information—such as data from home genetic-testing kits and biometric security at airports—have spun a “worldwide surveillance web” that makes it harder for <small>MI</small>6 officers to operate abroad without their names and histories being uncovered.</p><p class="article__body-text">That Mr Moore chose to air such concerns in a public forum is itself a novelty. His agency was not officially avowed, nor were its chiefs named, until some years after he joined it in 1987. Perhaps because of the years he spent above-board as a diplomat, he is unusually communicative. He continues to operate his Twitter account, a rarity among spymasters.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such openness also has a wider purpose, however. As threats evolve, intelligence services must work with tech companies and other outside talent to stay ahead. That requires, said Mr Moore, a “sea-change…in <small>MI</small>6’s culture, ethos and way of working”. The same urgency is visible in increasingly vigorous attempts to recruit a wider range of people, something it has struggled to do despite years of effort.</p><p class="article__body-text">In 2021, <small>MI</small>6 even began advertising in <em>The Economist</em> for “individuals with diverse skill sets and life experiences” to take part-time and consulting roles. More surprisingly still, it welcomed applications from British and foreign nationals alike. The result is a seeming paradox. “To stay secret,” said Mr Moore, “we are going to have to become more open.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Open book"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%E2%80%99s%20chief%20spook%20sees%20China%20as%20the%20main%20intelligence%20threat&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F91k8l4dqtfr4rpia79f9kncii7qu62hr&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
