A survey by the Office for National Statistics (<small>ONS</small>) carried out in June found that around four in ten firms trading in services reported that the end of the transition period had hit their business. Around three-quarters said the pandemic had.</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, the <small>ONS</small> has done its best to disentangle the effects of the two. A study published on July 27th compares exports and imports with the <small>EU</small> and those with the rest of the world. Those with the <small>EU</small> have fallen more. In the two years ending in March 2021 the share of all service exports accounted for by the <small>EU</small> fell by more than a percentage point, to 36.5%. The fall in the <small>EU</small>’s share of imports is more striking still: around nine percentage points, to 37.9%.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Much of that fall in imports is accounted for by financial services. The British government had hoped to have signed a deal by now granting “equivalence”, that is, mutual recognition of regulatory standards in the sector. That would have made it easier to sell financial products originating in Britain in the <small>EU</small>, and vice versa. But no deal has yet been struck. Meanwhile business travel between Britain and the <small>EU</small> now requires a visa, and the export of services in professional areas such as law, accountancy, architecture and engineering has been hampered by the end of mutual recognition of qualifications.</p><p class="article__body-text">Complicating the <small>ONS</small>’s analysis is the fact that, before the pandemic, Britain’s services trade with the <small>EU</small> differed from that with the rest of the world. A service-provider such as an architect can sell designs without leaving the office or, alternatively, go on a road-show. In 2019 around 15% of services trade with the <small>EU</small> was of a sort that typically involves people travelling, compared with 11% of services trade with the rest of the world. That means trade in services with the <small>EU</small> was more vulnerable to the effect of travel restrictions. Overall, however—and hardly surprisingly—making trade more complicated does indeed seem to have reduced it. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Doing a disservice"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20pandemic%20has%20disrupted%20services%20trade&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-31&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F66uhu4bt1km4v37abebkbs7ko8ao3ici&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
