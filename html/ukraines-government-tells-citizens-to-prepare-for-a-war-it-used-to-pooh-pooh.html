Some prophecies have even had precise times attached: at one point American officials suggested that Russia would go to war at 3am on February 16th. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has spent months pooh-poohing the prospect of war, ended up marking the date as a “day of unity”. Some Ukrainians were even jolly enough to wish one another an ironic “Happy Invasion Day”.</p><p class="article__body-text">As recently as February 22nd Mr Zelensky reiterated, “There will be no war.” That may be the last time he makes such a prediction. Later the same day he called up the Ukrainian army’s 200,000 reservists. The next day he declared a 30-day state of emergency. While that is not martial law, which will be imposed only after a full-blown Russian invasion, it gives the government extra powers to prepare and keep order. Perhaps more importantly, it was the clearest signal yet from the government that citizens should prepare for war. The government also urged all Ukrainian citizens to leave Russia immediately, presumably for fear of attacks on them if hostilities begin.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In a speech on February 21st, Mr Putin had argued that Ukraine only exists thanks to an arbitrary administrative decision by Vladimir Lenin, who oversaw the creation of the Soviet Union’s republics after the Communists took control of imperial Russia in 1917. In Ukraine’s case, Mr Putin argued, Lenin was “severing what is historically Russian land”. The speech was meant to boost support for war at home, but Ukrainians were watching too. Come Back Alive, a fundraiser for the military, received more donations the following day than in the whole prior year.</p><p class="article__body-text">In a sure sign of impending cataclysm, Ukrainian politics, usually dysfunctional to the point of farce, has suddenly become fraternal and consensus-driven. Petro Poroshenko, the president’s political nemesis, has showed support for his speech on February 21st, in which he decried Mr Putin for recognising the self-declared “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk. The next day Mr Zelensky met with the heads of other political parties to establish a defence coalition. An overwhelming majority of lawmakers voted to give the cabinet new discretion over defence spending. The state of emergency has not attracted criticism, even though it gives the government the power to crack down on opposition protests.</p><p class="article__body-text">This might help explain, along with some uncharacteristic sunshine in February, why the mood in Kyiv is at once macabre and slightly cheerful. Elation has followed the arrival of new sanctions on Russia from the West, including the longed-for suspension by Germany of Nord Stream 2, a big gas pipeline from Russia on the verge of going into service. And it still helps that large sections of the population remain unconvinced that war is coming. “We are on the defensive,” concedes Nina, a retiree in Kyiv. “But I very much hope that war won’t happen.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The mood offers two lessons. First, whatever Lenin’s role in creating a Ukrainian national identity a century ago, Mr Putin has surely outdone him as a progenitor of Ukrainian patriotism. Ukraine is never as united as when collectively recoiling at the Russian president’s words. Second, Ukraine’s politics is not quite as combustible as many feared (or as Russia hoped). Ukrainians seem willing to cut their president some slack in an extraordinarily difficult situation, and are willing to unite in the face of a common threat. Polls show that a large share of the population expresses a willingness to take up arms and fight against a Russian occupation.</p><p class="article__body-text">Now comes the next moment in the psychological war: the task of bending to the reality of a conflict without breaking before it. Ukrainian troops on the frontlines are receiving demoralising messages from Russian cyber-warriors directly to their inboxes. Mr Zelensky may still see his task as preparing society for war without inducing an exodus of frightened citizens or an economic collapse. “He was afraid of panic. But Ukrainians do not panic,” says Oleksander Danilyuk, a former finance minister. Mr Zelensky remains in Kyiv, despite cajoling from the American government to move to Lviv, close to the Polish border in the west. Millions of Ukrainians will stay with him there, come what may.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For more stories on the potential for, and possible impact of, conflict in eastern Europe, visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/23/how-much-pain-will-the-wests-sanctions-cause-vladimir-putin">hub</a></i></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Ukraine%E2%80%99s%20government%20tells%20citizens%20to%20prepare%20for%20a%20war%20it%20used%20to%20pooh-pooh&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-23&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ft3dnahrrt54f76mdp8tbsgutdvkf1ddk&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
