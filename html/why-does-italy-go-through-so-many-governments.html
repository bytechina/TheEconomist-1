Surveys indicate that the most likely outcome is a solidly right-wing government headed by Giorgia Meloni, who leads the Brothers of Italy party. She would be Italy’s first woman prime minister and the first to have belonged to the country’s now-defunct neo-fascist party. Whatever the outcome, Italy will have its 70th government since the end of the second world war—on average, one every 13 months. Why does the country have so many short-lived governments?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The turnover is actually more apparent than real. Since it is not the prime minister but Italy’s president who formally appoints ministers, the head of government normally has to resign to reshuffle the cabinet or coalition. Silvio Berlusconi was in office continually from 2001 to 2006. But in 2005 he changed his ministers, so technically he had two governments in succession. Apply the same approach to France and you find it has had even more cabinets than Italy over the same period.</p><p class="article__body-text">But there are two important differences. France’s turnover was concentrated in the days of its Fourth Republic, before 1959. And since it is the president in France who wields the real clout, changes of prime minister tend not to be accompanied by such radical changes of direction as occur nowadays in Italy—even, sometimes, without a change of prime minister. Giuseppe Conte, an Italian former premier and current leader of the left-leaning, populist Five Star Movement (M5S), initially formed a cabinet with the hard-right Northern League. His second was with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).</p><p class="article__body-text">The explanation for Italy’s governmental instability used to be the peculiar nature of its cold-war politics. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) was the biggest in western Europe. To keep it out of power, the centre-right Christian Democrats formed an endless series of coalitions with the remaining parties. Until a socialist, Bettino Craxi, became prime minister in 1983, a fair bit of continuity underlay the frequent turmoil. But that no longer holds water. Since the end of the cold war, Italy has continued to lurch from one melodramatic crisis to the next, with 20 governments since the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">One reason is Italy’s reliance on proportional representation, which creates a multiplicity of parties. Electoral laws, including the current one, have encouraged the formation of coalitions, by introducing thresholds for entry to parliament and/or an element of first-past-the-post. But that does not prevent electoral coalitions, and parties, disintegrating once the votes are in. The latest crisis can be traced to a split in the M5S last month. Luigi Di Maio, the foreign minister, walked out in protest at the party’s reluctance to endorse arms shipments to Ukraine. More than 60 Five Star lawmakers have since followed him into a new group called Together for the Future.</p><p class="article__body-text">At the root of Italy’s political instability is the willingness of lawmakers to abandon the parties for which they were elected—a constant in the country’s democratic politics since the late 19th century. Of the 945 deputies and senators elected at the last general election in 2018, 322 had changed their political affiliation by the end of May 2022. That was before the exodus from the M5S. Beppe Grillo, its founder, has argued that turncoats should resign their seats. Yet no such obligation exists in, say, America and legislators there “cross the aisle” far less than in Italy. Most explanations thus fall back on cultural and historical factors, such as Italy’s long, pre-unification experience of rule by undependable foreigners and the resulting dangers of being seen to be loyal to any one faction. Ultimately, though, such explanations are mere guesses.</p></div></body></html>
