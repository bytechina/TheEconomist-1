Since she took office in 2005, America and France have been through four presidents each, Britain has seen five prime ministers and Italy no fewer than eight. But at home an entire generation has grown up with no memory of another leader. In September 2.8m of these <em>Merkelkinder</em>, making up nearly 5% of the electorate, will be eligible to vote for the first time in a federal election. <em>The Economist</em> met a few at the Sophienschule, a <em>Gymnasium </em>(grammar school) in Hanover. All are near or have just finished their final year of schooling.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-youngs-attitudes.mp3" title="The attitudes of Germany’s young"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">For some, the experience of covid-19 was a harsh reminder of political reality in a country where the over-60s make up well over a third of eligible voters. “The pandemic showed how unimportant younger voters really are,” says Marie Sophie Scholz. “Apart from our teachers, no one cared.” All the students have harrowing accounts of failed technology, disrupted home lives, lost motivation and loneliness. Some say their pandemic experiences will influence their vote.</p><p class="article__body-text">Climate concern looms large. Many students have participated in Fridays for Future climate marches. “The average voter is in their 50s, so for us it’s not enough to vote,” says Julian Köppen. “But we can demonstrate.” Marie is infuriated by condescending politicians who dismiss such actions as excuses for truancy: “If they don’t act now, politics will become a very dark place.” Hannah Sprengel grumbles: “They see what we do, but don’t act.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Julian is excited by a court ruling that partly struck down the climate law for not taking sufficiently into account the rights of future generations. This approach to sustainability, he reckons, must extend beyond climate to areas like the digitalisation of schools. Max Brinkmann wants more focus on inequality and pensions—and thinks change comes from collective movements (he has joined the <small>SPD</small>). For Julian, a big issue is “security”, by which he means “avoiding international conflicts and not provoking other leaders.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Mrs Merkel was good at that, he reckons. All students appreciate the chancellor’s calm, rational approach to politics, in contrast to what Max fears has become an “emotional and populist” campaign. “We will miss her,” he says, while conceding that the chancellor “pushed away problems” that seemed too hard to solve. There is some scepticism about assuming Mrs Merkel’s departure will mean rupture. “We don’t have to be nervous,” says Hannah. “No one person will make or break a system.” Still, adds Marie, life after Merkel is “looking into the unknown”.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Full contents of this special report</strong><br/><a data-tegid="vim5u4eadi0hvvouclp7bp2ua4i84ggi" href="./after-merkel.html"><em>Germany: After Merkel</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="3r41vmk2pkuva4o60d84a4bcrd6k215h" href="./the-urgent-need-for-greater-public-investment.html"><em>The public sector: The urgent need for greater public investment</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="hr56cebb702uahkvitrr1m4k2j6e0l23" href="./a-troubled-road-lies-ahead.html"><em>The car industry: A troubled road lies ahead</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="f6b67rgh67pkb4ck6ljgu3c71uikobua" href="./parts-of-the-country-are-desperate-for-more-people.html"><em>The demographic challenge: Parts of the country are desperate for more people</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="82200k1mq2jo6ke5kkejl1n4g2ag8prj" href="./the-european-union-will-badly-miss-angela-merkel.html"><em>The European dilemma: The European Union will badly miss Angela Merkel</em></a><br/><em>Merkelkinder: The young’s attitudes</em>*<br/><a data-tegid="pv6rvko1qcbug56ahem4755qt7hs219a" href="./the-world-needs-a-more-active-germany.html"><em>Foreign and security policy: The world needs a more active Germany</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="11rvk9k0bet4r7p5rrgjddeo2i7o2ajo" href="./germany-needs-a-reforming-government.html"><em>The future: Germany needs a reforming government</em></a></p><div class="ds-chapter-list"><h2 class="ds-section-headline"><a class="ds-section-headline-link" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-09-25">Germany</a> <span class="ds-section-subheadline">After Angela</span></h2><ul><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/after-merkel"><span>After Merkel</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/the-urgent-need-for-greater-public-investment"><span>Germany’s urgent need for greater public investment</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/a-troubled-road-lies-ahead"><span>A troubled road lies ahead for German carmakers</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/parts-of-the-country-are-desperate-for-more-people"><span>Parts of Germany are desperate for more people</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/the-european-union-will-badly-miss-angela-merkel"><span>The European Union will badly miss Angela Merkel</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor ds-link-with-arrow--selected" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/the-youngs-attitudes"><span>The attitudes of Germany’s young</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/the-world-needs-a-more-active-germany"><span>The world needs a more active Germany</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/09/20/germany-needs-a-reforming-government"><span>Germany needs a reforming government</span></a></li></ul></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline "The young’s attitudes"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20attitudes%20of%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20young&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-20&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fhc237nvaqtek914psafk9rjovboaa0qb&amp;type=SR&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
