In elections on April 3rd his ruling coalition held on to its two-thirds share of the seats in parliament, a super-majority that allows it to change the constitution at will. His Fidesz party and its allies and cronies dominate the judiciary, and the country’s media are mostly controlled by friendly oligarchs. He hardly seems to need more power. Yet on May 24th he declared a national state of emergency, allowing him to rule by decree. </p><p class="article__body-text">In a video on his Facebook page, Mr Orban warned of inflation and economic upheaval, blaming both the war in neighbouring Ukraine and sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union. (No mention was made of Russia’s guilt in launching the war; the Hungarian prime minister is, by a long chalk, the most Russia-friendly leader in the EU.) As a result, Mr Orban said, his government “needs room for manoeuvre and the ability to take immediate action”. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Political analysts were not surprised. “He does whatever he wants anyway, but it seems that the opportunity to rule by decree is something like a drug,” said Andras Biro-Nagy of Policy Solutions, a liberal think-tank in Budapest. Indeed, the government already enjoyed the same powers under a state of emergency imposed during the covid-19 crisis, due to expire on June 1st. Less far-reaching powers declared during the migrant crisis in 2016 remain in force. </p><p class="article__body-text">Earlier the same day parliament passed a bill amending the constitution—for the tenth time since Mr Orban came to office in 2010—this time to allow for a state of emergency due to a war or disaster in a neighbouring state. Rule by decree gives Mr Orban some powers he would not otherwise have, says Kriszta Kovacs, a legal scholar at the WZB Berlin Social Science Centre. The government can issue orders that disregard the law and restrict civil rights. Rule by decree bypasses parliamentary scrutiny of legislation.</p><p class="article__body-text">On May 25th Mr Orban used his power of decree to announce a number of economic measures. One is a new fund to pay for government subsidies of consumer utility prices, a system, in place since 2012, that is among the government’s most popular policies, according to Mr Biro-Nagy, but has become increasingly costly since the start of the war. Hungary gets 85% of its gas and 65% of its oil from Russia. Safeguarding that supply is one reason why Mr Orban has so far blocked an EU move to embargo Russian oil.</p><p class="article__body-text">The subsidies fund will be financed with new taxes on companies that, Mr Orban thinks, have benefited from inflation caused by the war. “With rising interest rates and rising prices, banks and large multinationals are reaping greater profits,” he said. The government will impose windfall taxes on “banks, insurers, large retail chains, energy and trading companies, telecommunications companies and airlines”. The revenues will also finance another new fund to increase Hungary’s defence budget.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The government had already imposed other inflation-fighting measures, including price controls on petrol and on several kinds of food. Higher taxes on corporations (especially international ones) are a predictable way for Mr Orban’s government to address its growing budget deficit, says Daniel Prinz, a Hungarian economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a British research group. But it faces no immediate emergency. Year-on-year GDP growth in the first quarter of 2022 was 8.2%, notes Zoltan Pogatsa, an economist at the University of West Hungary—though the comparison is misleading because a year earlier some covid lockdowns were still in place.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some commentators, such as Zoltan Kiszelly of the Szazadveg Foundation, a government-linked think-tank, cited the risk of a new Ukrainian refugee crisis as a reason for rule by decree. But refugee inflows from Ukraine have shrunk dramatically.</p><p class="article__body-text">A more plausible explanation may be Mr Orban’s strained relations with the EU. The European Commission has blocked covid aid to Hungary, citing violations of the rule of law, and has started a procedure that would bar other aid as well. It also complains that Hungary has allowed the covid state of emergency to persist too long. A fresh one based on the war in Ukraine forces the commission to launch a new analysis, notes Kim Lane Scheppele, a legal scholar at Princeton, who follows Mr Orban’s government closely.</p><p class="article__body-text">More important, Ms Scheppele thinks, is the ability to issue decrees that would otherwise violate the law. The government can bury new measures in directives from the prime minister’s office. “Orban can do one thing in the parliament for public consumption and something else by decree that only those of us obsessively reading the <i>National Gazette</i> [where government records are published] will know,” she says.</p></div></body></html>
