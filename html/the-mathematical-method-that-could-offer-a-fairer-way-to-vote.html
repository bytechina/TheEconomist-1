The book’s author, Lewis Carroll, took a keen interest in the quirks of electoral contests. He would later write a treatise on “the dust and din” of Britain’s 19th-century voting reforms, under his real name, Charles Dodgson. (The animals’ huffing and puffing may also mock the circuitous deliberations of Christ Church College, Oxford, where Carroll spent his life, often locking horns with the dean, father of a real-life Alice.) Most election pundits lavish vast attention on the political creatures in the competition and the prizes they might win. But Carroll was different. A mathematician and logician, he turned his eccentric intelligence to the rules of the race.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">To most, this is the driest subject in politics. But the rules of the race can change the course of nations.</p><p class="article__body-text">The rules of the race helped dictate the outcome of two of the most consequential votes in recent history: the election of Donald Trump as the Republicans’ presidential nominee in 2016 and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in the same year. In each case, the rules of the race seemed straightforward, commonsensical and unobjectionable. Both produced a clear winner. But what if the rules had been switched? What if the Brexit referendum had looked more like the primary, and the primary more like the referendum?</p><p class="article__body-text">In the primaries, each voter picked one candidate and the contender with the most votes won. It is a method so familiar as to almost defy examination. And yet its disadvantages have long been recognised. Back in 1873, Carroll lamented its “extraordinary injustice”. Imagine, he wrote, if one of four candidates is the first choice of 36% of voters but hated by everybody else. Another is the first choice of a slightly smaller percentage but the second choice of everyone else. The second candidate should win. But the rules of the race would conspire in favour of the first.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the Republican primary, opposition to Mr Trump was fragmented among numerous rival candidates—as many as 11 in the early contests. A different set of rules might have winnowed the field earlier to leave Mr Trump facing a single opponent, such as John Kasich, hated by none, liked by many, but the first choice of few. That would have made the primary more akin to a straight-up yes-no referendum on Mr Trump’s candidacy. In that case, some polls suggest, he might have lost the race.</p><p class="article__body-text">The result of the Brexit referendum would also have been different if the myriad versions of Brexit (modelled on Australia, Norway, Switzerland and so on) had been pitted against Remain and each other. Opposition to the <small>EU</small> would have been fragmented among many alternatives. And Remain would have triumphed like Mr Trump.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="christmas-2021-videos_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">Some people think Brexit was an example of a voting paradox almost as surreal as the Dodo’s caucus-race. Of the three broad options—Remain, hard Brexit and soft Brexit—each could beat one of the others but not both. If asked, Britain would have preferred a soft Brexit to remaining a member of the <small>EU</small>, because even hardened Eurosceptics thought some kind of exit was better than none. Voters would have preferred Remain to a hard Brexit, because of the economic chaos entailed by such a disruptive departure. But they would have preferred a hard Brexit to a soft one, because if the country was going to go to all the trouble of leaving the <small>EU</small> it might as well regain control of immigration.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>The rules of the race can change the course of nations</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Carroll proposed a number of alternative voting methods to bring races to a more satisfactory conclusion. One was a version of the “method of marks”. Each voter is given a number of points or “marks” to spread across candidates as they see fit. They would give the most marks to their favourite candidate. But they might also give a few to acceptable alternatives. This would allow voters to express both the fact of their support and its intensity.</p><p class="article__body-text">Polarising figures like Mr Trump would attract lots of marks from some voters, but none from others. They might therefore lose to choices that earned a few marks from everyone. “This Method would, I think, be absolutely perfect,” Carroll wrote in 1873, if only voters were “sufficiently unselfish and public-spirited” to reserve some marks for their second or third choices. But in practice, he thought, voters would “lump” all of their marks on their favourite candidate—if only because they worried that others would do the same.</p><h2>Across the quad</h2><p class="article__body-text">Carroll never really overcame this problem. The intellectual baton instead passed to another eccentric enigmatologist, who provided the ingredients for a solution shortly after the second world war. Like Carroll, Lionel Penrose was educated as a mathematician (at Cambridge not Oxford) before becoming a medical doctor and geneticist at University College London. Like Carroll he was fond of riddles, paradoxes and inconclusiveness. He and his son documented some of the “impossible objects” (such as the never-ending staircase that leads up to its own foot) made famous by M.C. Escher. In his 16th-century country home, he was amused by a tree with roots that grew upwards.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">According to one obituarist, he also knew how to be “difficult” in committee if things went the wrong way. Indeed, his ingenious contribution to the theory of voting was to write down the mathematics of getting one’s way. Being difficult, he proved, is often easier than you might think. The power of a single committee member was surprisingly hard to dilute.</p><p class="article__body-text">To see why, imagine a committee of three people—call them Tom, Dick and Harry. Their votes can in principle fall eight different ways. (A proposal can gain support from all three or none. It could win backing from Tom and Dick alone; Dick and Harry alone or Tom and Harry alone. Alternatively, these same three pairings could oppose it.) In four of these combinations, Tom can change the outcome, turning a knife-edge victory or defeat into its opposite. A voter’s chances of finding themselves in this pivotal position serves as a good index of their “power”. So in a small three-person committee, their power is four out of eight or 50%.</p><p class="article__body-text">What if the committee were three times bigger? You might think that would divide a voter’s power by three. You would be wrong. In a committee of nine, there are 512 different combinations of votes. An individual voter can decide the result in as many as 140 of these, because the other votes are evenly split. By the same index, the voter’s power is 140 out of 512 or 27.3%—down by less than half.</p><p class="article__body-text">Why is that? The voter is now only one of nine, diluting their influence. But this dilution is partly offset by another consideration, as Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research has pointed out: with nine members, many more potential knife-edge combinations of votes exist. A voter’s power diminishes as a committee grows in size, but it does not shrink proportionately. It shrinks at a more gentle pace, proportionate not to the size of the committee but to the square root of its size. The voter’s power, Penrose pointed out, diminishes as the roots grow upwards.</p><p class="article__body-text">Writing just after the second world war, Penrose had bigger concerns in mind than university politics. He was intrigued by the best way to allocate votes to countries in a “world assembly” like the United Nations, established only months earlier. Giving every country a single vote, regardless of its size, was undemocratic. The obvious solution was to award votes in proportion to population. But that would give big countries too much clout, Penrose argued.</p><p class="article__body-text">He instead proposed a middle way between the two. Each country should be allocated a number of votes corresponding not to the size of its population, but to the square root of its population. The population required for one thousand votes might be one million. For two thousand, four million. For three thousand, nine million. To put it another way, the population required for a given number of votes should be that number multiplied by itself (or squared).</p><p class="article__body-text">Penrose’s idea reappeared when the <small>EU</small> mulled reforms to its voting rules in 2007. Poland worried that big countries like Germany would have too much sway. So it adopted an odd slogan for the summit: “the square root or death”. The phrase “neatly combines obscurity, absurdity and vehemence,” as Gideon Rachman of the <em>Financial Times</em> (and formerly of <em>The Economist</em>) put it, “capturing the spirit of the modern <small>EU</small>”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Despite this vehemence, the proposal got nowhere. But something similar in form has been proposed by Glen Weyl, a political economist now at Microsoft Research. He calls it quadratic voting or <small>QV</small>. In its simplest version, each voter would be given a budget of “marks” as Carroll might call them or “voice credits” as Mr Weyl calls them. Voters could use these credits to “buy” votes for a candidate or proposal. The first vote for a candidate costs one credit. But casting two votes for a single candidate costs four credits (ie, two squared); casting three costs nine (three squared), and so on. Under this scheme, people buy votes with their credits just as countries “earn” votes with their populations in Penrose’s imagined assembly. In both cases, the aim is to give voters as much sway as their population or passion warrants. But no more so.</p><p class="article__body-text">Compared with the method of marks, <small>QV</small> makes it harder to “lump”’ votes. That is because each additional vote for a single candidate costs more than the last one did. (A second vote costs an additional three credits; a third vote costs an additional five.) Thus instead of buying increasingly expensive votes for their number-one choice, voters are nudged to cast some relatively cheap votes for second- or third-choice options. In this way, the method encourages compromise.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the book “Radical Markets”, Mr Weyl and his co-author Eric Posner argue that the method could potentially work well in organisations large and small, from the United Nations to presidential elections, from shareholder meetings to homeowner associations. By their reckoning, it would also have left Mr Trump trailing Mr Kasich in 2016. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of a blockchain platform called Ethereum, has used similar principles to govern his crypto-community’s decision-making. He describes it as “an initial foray into a fundamentally new class of social technology”.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Even minorities could occasionally prevail over quadratically constrained majorities</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">In principle, this social technology gives people a reason to express, but not overstate, the intensity of their feelings. To see how that works, imagine that one voter would happily part with $1,000 if it would magically guarantee their candidate a victory. A second more passionate supporter would pay twice as much. They both calculate that casting an extra vote will increase the odds of victory by the same small percentage (say 1%). And they privately value each voice credit at the equivalent of about $1 (even if they cannot literally sell them for money).</p><p class="article__body-text">The first voter enters the poll. Since a vote increases the chance of their candidate winning by about 1%, it is worth roughly $10 in their mind (1% of $1000). The first vote, which costs only one credit or the equivalent of $1, is a bargain. So is the second, third and fourth. By the time they have cast five votes (for a combined cost of 25 credits), a sixth would cost 11 credits (six squared is 36, which is 11 more than 25). That is the equivalent of $11. So it is not worth buying.</p><p class="article__body-text">The more passionate supporter values each vote at $20. Once they have cast ten votes (for 100 credits), an eleventh would cost them an additional 21 credits. So they limit themselves to ten. That is twice as many as the first supporter, accurately reflecting the fact that they care twice as much about the issue.</p><p class="article__body-text">The result could be quite different under a simpler system of one-credit-one-vote. If each vote cost a flat one credit, the passionate voter would snap them up, until they had exhausted their budget, or until victory was so assured an additional vote was not worth buying. The other, milder supporter might do the same, in which case the result would fail to differentiate between them. Or, knowing that stronger supporters were blowing their budgets for the cause, the milder supporter might not bother to buy any votes at all. That would again misrepresent their true feelings.</p><p class="article__body-text">Distinguishing strong from mild support is equally valuable in opinion polling. In 2016 David Quarfoot of the University of California, San Diego and his co-authors put ten controversial policy proposals to 4,850 American voters. They included proposals to raise the minimum wage, deport illegal immigrants, repeal Obamacare and tax the rich. Some of the voters were asked to respond on a conventional scale (from strongly approve to strongly disapprove). Others were given a budget of 100 voice credits to spend quadratically.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the conventional survey, people tended to gravitate to one end of the scale or the other. They expressed strong approval or disapproval, just as online reviewers tend to give five stars or none. In both cases, a strong statement costs nothing. In the quadratic poll, people faced a constraint. Expressing vehemence on one issue required them to weaken their stand on another. This constraint forced them to be more discerning about their passions.</p><h2>QV, see</h2><p class="article__body-text">Mr Weyl suggested the method to Chris Hansen, who is now a state senator in Colorado. The Democratic legislators used <small>QV</small> to help pick which of many possible spending bills they should push in the year ahead. It is also used in Taiwan to help decide among the innovations cooked up in the annual Presidential “Hackathon”, which challenges civic entrepreneurs to use data to improve public services. In Brazil the city council of Gramado has also used quadratic voting to set its priorities for the year and to find consensus on tax amendments. It is a way to go beyond “the simplicity of yes or no,” says Professor Daniel, the council’s president. “At first we faced some scepticism, we found it strange,” he says. But after the councillors were trained, “everyone understood the idea, which is the search for consensus, for a democracy of the future.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Quadratic voting does sound strange. Like the caucus-race in Wonderland, the “best way to explain it is to do it”. And so <em>The Economist</em> is inviting readers to take part in an <a href="/QuadraticPoll">online quadratic poll</a> modelled on the experiment by Mr Quarfoot and his co-authors. The proposals include: should countries impose a carbon tax? Should they legalise assisted dying? Should Britain reverse Brexit? You can express how you feel about these proposals, and how strongly, by taking part.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Posner and Mr Weyl have big dreams for their moderation machine. They imagine a world in which citizens would spend from a lifetime budget of voice credits on regular referendums. An individual who felt strongly about a single issue could hoard their credits until its moment arrives, then blow all of their saved credits on it. That would allow passionate minorities occasionally to outvote indifferent majorities.</p><p class="article__body-text">In this vision, voters could enter and exit electoral contests when the spirit moves them. In that way it would resemble Carroll’s caucus-race. And since even minorities could occasionally prevail over quadratically constrained majorities, everyone could win at some point. As the Dodo said, “All must have prizes.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ILLUSTRATIONS: TIMO LENZEN</small></p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="christmas-style-fixes_index.html"></iframe></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure></div></body><script>
