Its working title, the “Advanced Research Projects Agency’’, is a clue to the model. Copying the American agency of the same name set up in 1958, which continues to sponsor programmes such as a competition to design robots that can help in natural disasters (contestant pictured above), was one of the priorities of Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s former chief adviser.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210206_BRC641.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20210206_BRC641.png" srcset="../image/20210206_BRC641.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The aim of the scheme is to boost “blue skies” research—high-risk projects that have the potential to hand Britain a stake in a technology that will define the future. The prime example is <small>ARPA</small>net, the precursor to the internet which <small>ARPA</small> developed in the late 1960s. America still exerts disproportionate heft over the internet as a result. Silicon Valley’s predilection for big, risky investments was also an inspiration to Mr Cummings, though venture capitalists’ time-horizons are shorter.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>D</small><small>ARPA</small> (<small>D</small> for defence was added in 1972) model which gave birth to <small>ARPA</small>net was to hire specialist “programme managers” to run each of its research projects, rather than—as most national research bodies do—just giving money to scientists and letting them get on with it. British <small>ARPA</small> is likely to follow that model, and will have plenty of autonomy. Britain’s other publicly funded research agency, <small>UK</small> Research and Innovation (<small>UKRI</small>), operates in a more constrained manner, with more oversight over its spending than British <small>ARPA</small> will probably have. <small>UKRI</small>’s boss, Ottoline Leyser, has said she sees a place for institutions in which the funding model as well as the research are more experimental.</p><p class="article__body-text">The idea is promising, but two elements that helped America’s research effort may be in short supply. One is money. The £800m ($1.1bn) that was earmarked for the science agency in the 2020 budget—its launch was delayed—is a drop in the ocean. America spends 2.8% of its <small>GDP</small>—a whopping $550bn a year—on <small>R</small>&amp;<small>D</small>. Yet public money may help researchers to attract funding from elsewhere, so it may have a multiplicative effect.</p><p class="article__body-text">Another important element in <small>ARPA</small>’s success was the mood in America when it was created. A national research effort works best when there is a goal to rally around. In the 1950s America, cold-war competition with the Soviet Union combined with the United States’ global leadership in the wake of the second world war to provide that cohesion. Not just <small>ARPA</small>, but a host of other American national laboratories also made a string of wondrous discoveries. Bell Labs, the research division of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, then a regulated monopoly, developed the transistor, the laser and the Unix operating system. “The Idea Factory”, a book on Bell Labs’ history, argues that the sense of unified national purpose at the time motivated those discoveries. No doubt the government hopes that the combination of Brexit and covid-19 will unleash that spirit in Britain.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Blue skies ahead"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20new%20science%20agency%20is%20part%20of%20plans%20to%20transform%20research%20in%20Britain&amp;publicationDate=2021-02-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fa8n7a9b83bvemvi70atj38pb7aan3cg3&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
