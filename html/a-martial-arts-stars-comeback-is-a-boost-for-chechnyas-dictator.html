Chechen-born Khamzat Chimaev, known as the <em>borz</em> (“wolf”), fights as ferociously as his nickname suggests. He was one of the world’s hottest mixed-martial arts (<small>MMA</small>) stars in 2020, before being laid low by a tough opponent: a brutal bout of covid-19. He considered retiring, but was dissuaded—not by his coach or sponsors, but reportedly by Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s ruler. In July Mr Chimaev announced that, after a year-long break, he is training for a fight in October.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/a-martial-arts-stars-comeback-is-a-boost-for-chechnyas-dictator.mp3" title="A martial-arts star’s comeback is a boost for Chechnya’s dictator"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Kadyrov controls everything in the Russian republic, from dress codes to religious practices. He crushes dissenters, but loves combat sports and builds gyms for his subjects to punch and grapple. At bouts in his <small>MMA</small> arena in Grozny, the capital, he hollers, whoops and embraces the winners.</p><p class="article__body-text">Many young Chechens dream of becoming famous fighters. Some are treated like heroes, plastered on billboards and housed in luxury flats. A few of Mr Kadyrov’s prospects have battled in America’s money-spinning Ultimate Fighting Championship. But before the <em>borz</em>, Chechnya lacked a true superstar.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <em>borz’</em>s return was important to Mr Kadyrov—and not just because of his love for <small>MMA</small>. Mr Kadryov knows that Mr Chimaev will inspire more young Chechens to join fight clubs, where they will develop into highly trained, loyal warriors. Many will later join his private army. Some reckon that Mr Kadyrov’s gyms, called the “Akhmat Fight Club”, are recruiting pools for the Chechen special forces. (Both organisations have the same boss, Abuzayed Vismuradov, Mr Kadyrov’s right-hand man.)</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Chimaev’s comeback will bolster Mr Kadyrov’s image. Star fighters provide a distraction from his purges of those he deems weak, such as gay people. Blood sports also do well on Instagram. Mr Kadyrov presents himself as a strong, athletic ruler, like his patron, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. He recently sparred with the <em>borz </em>on camera, and in May the two holidayed together. They took selfies and met a lion cub.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "The wolf’s return"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20martial-arts%20star%E2%80%99s%20comeback%20is%20a%20boost%20for%20Chechnya%E2%80%99s%20dictator&amp;publicationDate=2021-08-05&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frlksgrkt1mtfbrv2k1c7a372t87gf5js&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
