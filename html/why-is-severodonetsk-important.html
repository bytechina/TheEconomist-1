It did not even rank in Ukraine’s 40 largest towns and cities. Yet over the past month it has become the pivotal battleground of the Russia-Ukraine war. Russian troops <a href="./russia-threatens-to-capture-severodonetsk.html">occupy its residential areas</a>. Ukrainian defenders and several hundred civilians, pounded by artillery, cling on in the Azot industrial plant in the west. On June 14th Russia destroyed the last bridge connecting Severodonetsk to the neighbouring town of Lysychansk. “In many respects, the fate of Donbas is being decided there,” declared Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, on June 8th. Why is Severodonetsk so important? </p><p class="article__body-text">The town has played an outsized role in the political and military <a href="./why-russia-has-never-accepted-ukrainian-independence.html">conflict between Russia and Ukraine</a> for two decades. In 2004, when protests at a rigged election erupted in Kyiv, local politicians in Severodonetsk played a prominent role in agitating for independence and threatened to ask Russia for military assistance. When an uprising toppled Ukraine’s pro-Russian president in 2014, Russia invaded Donbas and pro-Russian troops occupied Severodonetsk from May to July, when Ukrainian forces retook it. Since then it has remained in Ukrainian hands, just north of the line of contact dividing Russian and Ukrainian forces in Donbas.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/2806/90/media-assets/image/20220618_WOM941.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220618_WOM941.png" srcset="../image/20220618_WOM941.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">When Russia invaded Ukraine again on February 24th this year, it <a href="./joe-biden-says-that-vladimir-putin-has-decided-to-invade-ukraine.html">hoped to envelop</a> Ukrainian forces in Donbas in a big pincer movement, driving north from the Sea of Azov coastline and south from Kharkiv to converge on the city of Dnipro. When that ambitious manoeuvre proved beyond Russia’s depleted forces, they resorted to a more modest pincer—one thrust south from around Izyum and another north from Popasna—to capture a smaller Ukrainian salient jutting into Russian-held territory (see map). </p><p class="article__body-text">Severodonetsk lies at the eastern edge of that pocket and is the gateway to the north-east of Donetsk province, the other part of Donbas. It is an easier target for Russia because Ukrainian forces deeper in the salient have less coverage from air defences and artillery. Conquering it along with Lysychansk would open a path west to Slovyansk, the <a href="./the-turn-of-the-tide.html">first city to fall</a> to Russian proxies in 2014, and Kramatorsk, an industrial centre. Russia has been attacking Slovyansk from the north, but has struggled to break through. Ukraine holds higher ground, and at least one effort to cross the Sieversky-Donets river in May ended in disaster.</p><p class="article__body-text">Control of Severodonetsk would offer another avenue of approach—though by no means an easy one, since the Russians would still have to cross the river and assault next-door Lysychansk, which sits on a hill 150 metres higher than Severodonetsk. In that sense, Severodonetsk is by no means a decisive battle. But if Russia took it and Lysychansk, it would in effect control all of Luhansk. And if Slovyansk and Kramatorsk were eventually to fall, Russia would then control almost all of the biggest towns and cities in Donetsk province too. That, in turn, would allow it to claim that it had gone some way to meeting its stated war aim of “liberating” Donbas. </p><p class="article__body-text">Many expected Ukraine to retreat from Severodonetsk weeks ago. The town has little intrinsic significance beyond its recent history and Lysychansk is a more defensible spot. Instead Ukraine mounted counter-attacks and clung on. One aim is to bog down Russian forces, buying time until more Western weaponry arrives—<a href="./america-sends-advanced-missiles-to-help-ukraine-fend-off-russia.html">American rocket-launchers</a> are due imminently. On June 15th British defence intelligence said that Ukrainian resistance was preventing Russia from sending troops elsewhere. Another is to inflict steady casualties on Russia, further depleting its ranks. A third is that the city is a more favourable battleground for Ukraine’s preferred tactics of urban warfare, rather than long-range artillery duels on open ground where Russia retains the advantage. </p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">That resistance has come at a cost. Severodonetsk escaped serious violence in 2014. It was a “very nice, clean, cosy little city” before the war, says Brian Milakovsky, who lived there for six years until this January, working on humanitarian and development issues. It underwent a minor renaissance in recent years, says Mr Milakovsky, after it became the administrative capital, in lieu of occupied Luhansk city, and took in refugees from elsewhere in Luhansk. A sense of Ukrainian identity had been growing. Severedonetsk “was absolutely not a dead-end town”, he adds. Now, much of it lies in ruins.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">Ukraine crisis</a></i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./how-ukraine-is-fighting-back-against-russian-artillery.html">How Ukraine is fighting back against Russian artillery</a><br/><a href="./how-important-are-ukraines-trains-to-its-war-effort.html">How important are Ukraine’s trains to its war effort?</a><br/><a href="./what-does-it-take-to-join-nato.html">What does it take to join NATO?</a></p></div></body></html>
