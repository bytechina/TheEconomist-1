An older man struggles out of his seat. “Let’s face it, after the year we’ve had, many of us are carrying a few lockdown pounds,” says the voiceover. “Now’s the time to turn things around.” On the screen is a familiar logo to prompt people to action: three white letters, “<small>NHS</small>”, against a deep-blue background.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-extraordinary-power-of-the-nhs-brand.mp3" title="The extraordinary power of the NHS brand"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">When the government wants something done, it invokes the health service. In the early days of covid-19 ministers urged people to “stay at home, protect the <small>NHS</small>, save lives”. In an attempt to get those contacted to follow instructions, the test-and-trace system was labelled “<small>NHS</small> test and trace” despite being a standalone outfit. The “Better Health” campaign, of which the <small>TV</small> ad is a part, is in fact run by a separate government body, Public Health England.</p><p class="article__body-text">According to the database of <small>WPP</small>, a giant advertising agency, the health service is Britain’s strongest brand, beating the <small>BBC</small> and Amazon. Just like them, it has tight rules governing the use of its intellectual property. The logo, three decades old, must be Pantone 300 (or “<small>NHS</small> blue”). The font must be Frutiger. Imagery must “reflect the diversity of <small>NHS</small> patients, the public and staff”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">A study published by the health service in 2016 found that patients get “confused and unsettled by non-standard <small>NHS</small> branding”. They do not like other organisations employing the logo, worrying that this would “imply privatisation”. There was consternation when Islamic State set up the Islamic State Health Service, using similar imagery. So, too, when Brexiteers put the logo on the side of a bus, without permission, and promised the health service more cash.</p><p class="article__body-text">During the pandemic, firms from Premier League football clubs to John Hurd’s Organic Watercress (“donate 1p to the <small>NHS</small> from every pack purchased”) have rushed to show solidarity by plastering their products with the logo. Their enthusiasm may soon fade. The <small>NHS</small> is starting to grind through the longest queues since records began—a task that lacks the heroism of fighting a new virus, no matter how beloved the brand.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Spin doctors"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20extraordinary%20power%20of%20the%20NHS%20brand&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F29ppdb6mt0mb9b2u8893161abem6p85d&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
