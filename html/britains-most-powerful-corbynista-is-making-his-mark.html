He was radicalised by the miners’ strike and what he calls the anti-fascist movement. He talks warmly of “Jeremy” (Corbyn; Labour’s former far-left leader) and “John” (McDonnell, Mr Corbyn’s right-hand man). In 2019 Mr Driscoll won the leadership of the North of Tyne Combined Authority, which covers the north-east from Newcastle to the Scottish border, by running as a “proud socialist” endorsed by Momentum, Labour’s radical-left youth wing, and ageing leftist firebrand Noam Chomsky.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/britains-most-powerful-corbynista-is-making-his-mark.mp3" title="Britain’s most powerful Corbynista is making his mark"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Yet Mr Driscoll rivals Ben Houchen, the Tory mayor of the Tees Valley to his south, in his enthusiasm for the government’s signature, though still vaguely defined, policy: “levelling up”. Jobs are the most important source of prosperity and self-worth, he says; wealth-creation is a <em>sine qua non</em> of progress; the north-east needs to become the cradle of the new economy, just as it was of the old one. (Stephenson’s Rocket, one of the first steam trains, was tested near Newcastle city centre.) Asked to define a practical programme to give the slogan substance, he suggests three elements.</p><p class="article__body-text">The first is repurposing the infrastructure of the fossil economy for the green age. Cambois, a small town on the coast, is a monument to industrial decline. The pit closed in 1968. Three-quarters of school-leavers flee the town. A 230-acre industrial estate lies derelict. But the town still has the remnants of industrial-age infrastructure, including a railway line and nearby deep-water port. Britishvolt, a battery manufacturer, plans to build a gigaplant on the abandoned land, touted as on track to be Britain’s fourth-biggest building, and to repurpose the port and railway line. The ground was broken on September 6th.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The second is making the most of the region’s labour surplus. Verisure, a fast-growing Swedish alarm company, needs an army of workers to keep the phones manned 24 hours a day. The firm initially placed its operational headquarters in London, but was plagued by rapid turnover. After a national search for a better option, it plumped for Newcastle because of relatively cheap labour, a mellifluous accent and space to grow. Now that it is settled, says Kevin Croft, the site director, it recognises that even bigger advantages are affordable housing and short commutes that allow call-centre workers to live the middle-class dream.</p><p class="article__body-text">The third is reintegrating left-behind communities into the workforce. The Cedarwood Trust operates in the heart of Meadow Well, a poverty-stricken estate on Newcastle’s outskirts. Wayne Dobson and Alison Cunningham, two spokespeople, describe it as an “<small>A</small>&amp;<small>E</small> ward for social problems”, arguing that the two things locals need above all else are jobs and self-respect. For too many, unemployment has become a way of life. Children have had their self-respect stolen by dysfunctional parents and educational failure. The trust trains people for jobs, especially in Newcastle’s booming restaurant sector, prepares them for interviews by smartening them up and providing them with bus fares, and generally tries to instil self-confidence. Words such as “nurture”, “nourish” and “thrive”, painted on the walls, provide a stark contrast with the surrounding blight. For years, Cedarwood has been swimming against the economic tide because employers preferred young eastern Europeans. But after Brexit, foreign workers have become less readily available and local employers, including Britishvolt and Verisure, are suddenly keener on making the discouraged workless employable.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Cynics might doubt that Mr Driscoll played any part in all this. Mayors’ powers are limited—especially in artificial electoral regions such as the North of Tyne Combined Authority. (How could Northumberland, so rich in myth and poetry, acquire such an abomination of a name?) And much of the revival is the result of factors beyond his control, such as cheap land and labour. But it would be unfair to write him out of the equation. The mayor’s office provides an answer to what Mr Driscoll calls the “Henry Kissinger question”: whom do you call when you want to call the north-east? His Corbynista credentials help to sell business developments such as the one in Cambois to sceptical leftists such as the veteran local <small>MP</small>, Ian Lavery. And a touch of self-transformation about Mr Driscoll matches his prescription for the region. He grew up in a poor area of Middlesbrough, witnessed the murder of a schoolgirl by her estranged father and left school at 16. Only later did he seek success, becoming a third dan in jiu-jitsu and studying engineering at university as a mature student.</p><p class="article__body-text">Cynics are on stronger ground when they question how much Mr Driscoll’s approach owes to ideology. He repeatedly refers to ideas that were fashionable on the left when Corbynism was in its pomp, such as the entrepreneurial state (with government providing patient capital) and the circular economy (with local authorities buying from local companies to keep purchasing power in the region). The left regards his electoral success as a refutation of the belief held by Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Corbyn’s successor, that to reclaim the north, Labour needs to move rightward.</p><h2>Corbynism redux</h2><p class="article__body-text">In fact, Mr Driscoll’s success is a testament to the power of pragmatism over ideology. Had he gone into Parliament, he would be either plotting against Sir Keir or repeating Sir Keir’s talking points. As a regional mayor, he is working to solve practical problems: co-operating with businesses; building alliances with councillors from rival parties; sharing ideas with other mayors, including Tories such as Andy Street in the West Midlands; and cultivating connections with Downing Street. The most obvious reason to support devolution is to give people more say over their region; that it can convert a Corbynista into a pragmatic problem-solver is another. Executive authority has a way of maturing those who hold it. Parliamentary opposition, by contrast, tends to make them either impotent or infantile. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "North of the Tyne is mine"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%E2%80%99s%20most%20powerful%20Corbynista%20is%20making%20his%20mark&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-11&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fp33jlqldg9m3sful524qt1an6lnckt94&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
