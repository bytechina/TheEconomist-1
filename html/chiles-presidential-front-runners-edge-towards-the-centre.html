Yet Gabriel Boric (pictured), a 35-year-old former student-protest leader, has a good shot at being Chile’s next president. He made a name for himself railing against Chile’s highly successful economic system and criticising the centrist parties that have governed the country for most of the time since Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship ended in 1990.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/chiles-presidential-front-runners-edge-towards-the-centre.mp3" title="Chile’s presidential front-runners edge towards the centre"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Now Mr Boric, whose radical coalition includes communists, is leading opinion polls ahead of the second round of a presidential ballot set for December 19th. After narrowly losing the first round last month to a hard-right candidate, José Antonio Kast, Mr Boric has turned towards the centre to broaden his appeal. He wrote to the Christian Democrats asking forgiveness for his party’s “generational arrogance”. They endorsed him. Ms Bachelet followed on December 14th.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Boric has also invited centre-left economists to evaluate his economic programme. He now says he will raise taxes by a whopping 5% of <small>GDP</small> in four years, an initial step in his plan to raise them by a crushing 8% in six to eight years. His overhaul of pensions will be implemented gradually (details remain vague). He promises to stick to fiscal consolidation and to stabilise public debt. Earlier, he scrapped a requirement for workers to occupy half the seats on corporate boards.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Critics dismiss these changes as cosmetic. Mr Boric still proposes to abolish private pension funds, forgive student debt, shorten the working week, raise the minimum wage by half, increase the state’s role in areas such as telecoms and energy, and reserve at least 1% of government jobs for trans people. Economists fear that introducing all these measures together will harm growth. Ignacio Walker, a former leader of the Christian Democrats, also worries that Mr Boric may not be able to restrain his more radical left-wing allies.</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, Mr Boric appears to be convincing more voters of his moderation than Mr Kast, a conservative Catholic who defends the legacy of Pinochet and opposes abortion and same-sex marriage (which was legalised in Chile on December 9th). Mr Kast once proposed to eliminate the women’s ministry and close the National Institute for Human Rights; now he promises to “strengthen” the former and “profoundly reform” the latter. His critics decry the fact that Mr Kast’s late father, a German soldier, joined the Nazi party in 1942.</p><p class="article__body-text">The election remains wide open. A quarter of voters are undecided. Who ever wins will struggle to pass sweeping reforms: Chile’s Congress is divided and the country is in the process of rewriting its constitution, which could limit the powers of the executive. Mr Boric may soon learn that it is easier to protest than to govern.</p><p class="article__body-text"><em>Clarification (December 17th 2021): This article has been amended to clarify José Antonio Kast’s views on Augusto Pinochet’s legacy.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline "Curb your extremism"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Chile%E2%80%99s%20presidential%20front-runners%20edge%20towards%20the%20centre&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fks6our67adl6h5svocvq3miphmp2o4af&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
