In the early 1940s, many high-school students departed for the battlefield or for employment. But this time around, it is unclear where some of the missing students have gone—and many of them will not return. </p><p class="article__body-text">The pandemic forced schools around the world to close overnight in early 2020. In America more than 50m pupils were sent home in March. At the time, few imagined that the closures would drag on so long. As educators tried to get students back into the classroom in the autumn, enrolment dropped by 3% for the 2020-21 academic year. Teachers and administrators called families and even went to pupils’ homes in an attempt to get them back to school or at least to log in online.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Much of the decline took place among the youngest pupils: kindergarten enrolment (for five-year-olds) fell by 9%, and pre-kindergarten (for four-year-olds) by 22%. Switching to online learning was hardest for the youngest children. In the early years, lessons focus on life skills, such as learning how to use the toilet and getting along with peers—tasks that are difficult to learn over Zoom. Many families decided to keep their children at home.</p><p class="article__body-text">Preliminary enrolment figures for the current school year (2021-22) suggest that these overall declines will persist into 2022. Few districts have released their figures. Hawaii, one of the few to do so, has reported a loss. Pre-pandemic (2019-20), Hawaii’s school district enrolled 179,331 pupils. It reported 4,627 fewer students in the pandemic school year (2020-21). And in autumn 2021 it reported 3,104 fewer students than in the previous year—a 4% decline from pre-pandemic enrolment.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some children have simply dropped out. Some have <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/11/18/americas-catholic-schools-are-seeing-a-surprising-rise-in-enrolment">enrolled in private schools</a>, though probably not as many as suggested by media accounts. Home-schooling has become more popular. In Michigan, areas with remote-only instruction saw larger increases in private-school enrolment, whereas home-schooling increased more in areas with in-person teaching. Differing concerns about the virus have prompted families to make different choices. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Learning loss will continue to be a concern in 2022, especially among the youngest children</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Many pupils left for non-traditional public schools. The numbers attending virtual (online-only), charter (independently run) and vocational schools (focused on specific trades) all increased in Massachusetts last year. In Martha’s Vineyard and other vacation spots, enrolment in conventional public schools also went up, presumably as affluent families chose to weather the pandemic in their holiday homes.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some pupils may return to their former schools once the pandemic ends and teaching returns to normal. But some families will not want to move their children from the new schools into which they have happily settled. Expect to see private and non-traditional public school enrolments remain steady. But some children are now “missing”. Of those who left Hawaii’s school system in the 2020-21 academic year, for example, some left the state or started home-schooling, and a small proportion went to private schools. But 2,665 pupils are unaccounted for, says Mark Murphy, professor of education at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Learning loss will continue to be a concern in 2022, especially among the youngest children. Preliminary enrolment numbers suggest that many of last year’s would-be kindergarteners skipped it completely and started first grade in 2021 (kindergarten is not com- pulsory in most states). This will probably have a long-lasting impact: high-quality early learning is associated with increases in high-school performance, college attendance and adult wages. Those children could find themselves lagging behind their peers for years. </p><p class="article__body-text">Funding will also be a concern. In America, it is set on a per-pupil basis—so each missing child means less money for the school. Some states, such as Florida, let pupils take their state-allocated funding to any school, public or private. Expect such “voucher” schemes to be discussed more widely in 2022. </p><p class="article__body-text">Shortages of funding could lead to teacher-hiring freezes and a scaling back of other resources, such as educational materials, extracurricular activities and social programmes. Pandemic-relief funds are stemming the bleeding for now, but that will not last forever. Just as budget cuts reduced test scores and graduation rates in America after the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the impact of covid-19 on education will reach far beyond the pandemic’s end.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Tamara Gilkes Borr: US policy correspondent, The Economist, Washington, DC</i><span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2022 under the headline “Bottom of the class”</em></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=TWI&amp;title=Public-school%20enrolment%20in%20America%20is%20unlikely%20to%20return%20to%20normal&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-08&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frq85376c4a99d7fmgkcp3oaek1si7aij&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
