As usual the <em>Spectator</em>, the Tory house journal, had the best drinks. Policy Exchange, a right-leaning think-tank, had the best warm-up act in the form of Tory <small>MP</small> Michael Gove. A third event, a book launch for “Greater” by Penny Mordaunt, the paymaster-general, and Chris Lewis, was a veritable festival of Britishness. Guests were served scotch eggs and fish and chips.

Glance at the headlines and you will see a familiar world: the Liberal Democrats won a by-election and proclaimed a new era in politics; the tabloids published a picture of a minister kissing a woman who was not his wife, wrecking his marriage and career; the government announced it would get tough on law and order. And after being given an easy ride by voters who saw it almost as a government of national unity, the Conservative Party is falling back to earth. The latest Survation poll puts Labour just two points behind (37 to 39). Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is narrowing the gap with the prime minister on whom to favour for the top job (33 for Sir Keir to Boris Johnson’s 40). Sir Keir has resurrected some talent from Labour’s last stint in office, under Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown, and launched a grand tour to reintroduce himself to Britain, this time in person rather than over Zoom.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Two years ago Britain seemed dangerously unstable. The Labour Party was in the hands of Jeremy Corbyn and his clique of Stalin-apologists. Dominic Cummings, the mastermind of Vote Leave, was preparing shock therapy for Britain, in the manner of the <small>IMF</small> dealing with an eastern European country emerging from communism, or a spendthrift Latin American one. Two new outfits, the Brexit Party and Change <small>UK</small>, were promising to blow open an ossified political system. Parliament Square was the scene of perpetual protest and the destination of marches and counter-marches. <small>MP</small>s required police protection after death threats.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such nastiness is still in evidence. George Galloway, a provocateur who has stalked Labour’s fringes seemingly for ever, brought his distinctive brand of poison to the Batley and Spen by-election in early July. Later that month Kate Shemirani, a former nurse turned anti-vaxxer conspiracist, told thousands of protesters in Trafalgar Square that “at the Nuremberg trials doctors and nurses stood trial and they hung”. But the nasty tendency is in retreat. Sir Keir is scraping Labour’s hull clean of Marxist barnacles. Now out of Downing Street, Mr Cummings is dwindling into a pantomime villain who makes occasional television appearances to cackle and preen. The United Kingdom Independence Party, which played a big role in bringing about Brexit, is almost defunct and its former leader, Nigel Farage, is reduced to appearances on an ailing new television channel, <small>GB</small> News. Parliament Square is being retaken by its rightful owners: foreign tourists.</p><p class="article__body-text">The laws of economics are also reasserting themselves. During the covid-19 crisis the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, agreed to “spend what it takes” and Mr Johnson scattered money on the populace like a latter-day Roman emperor. Now the Treasury is flexing its muscles. Mr Sunak has played Scrooge with some high-profile demands, including a new Royal yacht and catch-up classes for children whose schooling was set back by lockdown.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Set against recent history, the new normal will look idiosyncratic. The bumbling, unpredictable Mr Johnson is not a normal prime minister, and the effects of covid-19 and Brexit are likely to last. Although cases are falling, more lockdowns are possible; politicians, whose business is meeting people, are particularly vulnerable to the “pingdemic” (being ordered by the national tracing app to stay home after having contact with someone infected). Both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak had to sit out the summer parties. Still, two outlines can be spied looming in the post-covid mist.</p><p class="article__body-text">The first is that the return to normal will be better for Labour than for the Conservatives. Sir Keir will be able to criticise Mr Johnson in ways that would have seemed churlish at the height of the crisis (a promised inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic will give him plenty of material). Meanwhile, contradictions within the Conservative coalition will become more apparent. So far Mr Johnson has been able to promise more spending for the poorer north without higher taxes on the richer south. That cannot continue for ever: eventually he will have to infuriate the Shire Tories or disappoint the Red Wall converts. “Having to make real choices is not compatible with the political coalition we’ve put together,” says one of the party’s more cerebral <small>MP</small>s.</p><h2>Back to life, back to reality</h2><p class="article__body-text">The second is that it will mean a return to drift and waffle—to 1990s John Major rather than 1980s Margaret Thatcher. On bread-and-butter issues, Mr Johnson will rely on government by headline rather than substance. On Scottish Independence, he will offer prevarication and delay. The Conservative Party will lurch between its big-government and Thatcherite personae. Meanwhile the Labour Party will reconcile itself to a leader who is too good to dump but not good enough to make the political weather.</p><p class="article__body-text">The expulsion of extremists from mainstream political parties is worth celebrating. Yet something has been lost in the waning of revolutionary fervour. Mr Cummings was widely regarded as a “nightmare”, but he was also right about some important things. Britain’s political parties are increasingly feeble; the administrative machinery of Whitehall is rusty; and the broader culture is complacent and backward-looking. Though infinitely preferable to the paralysis that seized the political system after the Brexit vote, the new normal will be far from what Mr Johnson and his fellow insurrectionists once promised: a national renaissance.</p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of matters relating to Brexit, visit our <a href="./page-not-found.html"> Brexit hub</a></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "The new normal"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Is%20Westminster%20going%20back%20to%20normal%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-31&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F5plo1eh0kimkj1lsar1fq0a5rkhfgro4&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
