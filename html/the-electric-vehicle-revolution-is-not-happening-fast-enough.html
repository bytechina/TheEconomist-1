But the relief carries an environmental cost. Transporting people and goods causes one-fifth of global carbon emissions. Many countries have drawn ambitious roadmaps to replace fossil-fuel burning vehicles with battery-powered ones to help dodge the worst of global warming.</p><p class="article__body-text">Thanks to <a href="/science-and-technology/new-800v-electric-cars-will-recharge-in-half-the-time/21803666">better batteries</a>, improved charging networks and generous government subsidies, electric vehicles (<small>EV</small>) are surging out of showrooms faster than you can say “lithium-ion battery”. Global electric-car sales more than doubled last year to 6.6m, about one in 12 new cars sold, according to a recent tally from the International Energy Agency (<small>IEA</small>), a global forecaster. About 30% were plug-in hybrids that also use petrol but can be twice as efficient as cars that only have internal-combustion engines (<small>ICE</small>s). Almost all the rest were battery-powered, which are twice as efficient again. A tiny share, about 15,000, relied on hydrogen fuel cells, an emerging technology that uses hydrogen to provide electricity. There are also 280m electric two- and three-wheeled vehicles on the road, according to Bloomberg<small>NEF</small>, a data outfit.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Some countries are transitioning quickly. Nearly nine in ten cars sold in Norway last year were electric, thanks to high taxes on <small>ICE</small> cars and decent charging infrastructure. In the past five years the number of <small>EV</small>s sold in Europe has grown at an average annual rate of 61%, making it the fastest-transitioning region of the world. <a href="/business/2022/04/09/save-globalisation-buy-a-chinese-ev">Sales in China</a> are speeding up too: last year <small>EV</small>s accounted for 16% of total car sales; the Chinese market is so big that these amounted to half of global sales. But America, the world’s second-largest car market after China, is lagging behind. Less than 5% of the cars sold there last year were electric; half of them were made by Tesla.</p><p class="article__body-text">If governments are to meet their climate goals, sales of <small>EV</small>s will have to accelerate rapidly. The 16m <small>EV</small>s on the road today make up a minuscule share of the world’s 1.2bn mostly fuel-guzzling cars. At current rates the <small>IEA</small> expects between 22% and 35% of car sales in 2030 to be electric. At best, by that point just 14% of the cars on the world’s roads will be <small>EV</small>s. Bloomberg<small>NEF</small> expects <small>EV</small>s to represent nearly one-quarter of car sales by 2025. But to meet the global goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, <small>EV</small>s will need to increase their new-car share to 60% by 2030 according to the <small>IEA</small>.</p><p class="article__body-text">That target is unlikely to be met. <small>EV</small> sales rose by 120% in 2021, but global supply-chain disruptions are likely to slow that growth rate. Shortages of minerals used for batteries will make matters worse. Heavily sanctioned Russia, for example, produces one-fifth of the high-grade nickel used in some <small>EV</small> batteries. And although the <a href="/business/a-lack-of-chargers-could-stall-the-electric-vehicle-revolution/21806663">charging network</a> for <small>EV</small>s is expanding rapidly, in many countries it will be neither extensive nor smart enough⁠—to manage the extra load on the grid—by 2030 to charge the 250m <small>EV</small>s required to be on track for net-zero emissions by 2050, in the unlikely event the world meets that target. The path to full <small>EV</small> adoption has many roadblocks ahead. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to <a href="/offthecharts/">Off the Charts</a>, our weekly newsletter.</i></p></div></body><script>
