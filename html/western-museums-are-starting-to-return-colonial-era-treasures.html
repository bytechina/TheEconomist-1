The bronzes are the thousands of metal castings and ivory sculptures that were taken from the west African kingdom of Benin (today in southern Nigeria, and not to be confused with the neighbouring Republic of Benin) by British troops in 1897. They have become emblematic of the increasingly charged debate over colonial loot in Western museums and private collections. Their fame derives both from their exquisite craftsmanship—when they arrived in Europe, critics compared them to objects from ancient Greece or Renaissance Italy—and from the brutal manner in which they were removed by the British from the palace in Benin City. </p><p class="article__body-text">There are more than a thousand Benin bronzes in Germany (curators bought loot from the expedition on the open market), and museums in several German cities have taken a collective decision to start the process of giving them back to Nigeria. They have been encouraged by the government, as well as a broad consensus among the main political parties. Nigeria’s ambassador to Germany, Yusuf Tuggar, says ownership must be transferred to his country with no preconditions. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Privately, German officials and curators express concern at divisions within Nigeria between the Oba of Benin (the region’s traditional king) and the local state government, and frustration at delays in building a secure facility to house the bronzes in the country. A compromise seems likely: the physical return of a minority of the objects, plus the legal transfer of the remainder, which will stay in Germany for now. </p><p class="article__body-text">For the rest of Europe, where many museums are stuffed with imperial plunder, the symbolic significance will be profound. “It’s a very important precedent,” says Barbara Plankensteiner, director of the Museum of World Cultures in Hamburg. Mr Tuggar puts it more bluntly: “We hope it will open the floodgates.” </p><p class="article__body-text">But will it? Britain has even more Benin bronzes than Germany has. The British Museum has the world’s largest collection, of about 1,000. In 2022 its critics will grow ever more indignant and vocal. The British Museum habitually responds to restitution claims with bland rebuffs from the press office. Expect more of these in the coming year, even as, behind the scenes, unease spreads among curators. </p><p class="article__body-text">Although the museum is willing to loan many of its treasures, including Benin bronzes, it is constrained by law from making permanent returns. The likelihood of Britain’s Conservative government amending the 1963 British Museum Act to enable the return of contested items is small. Decisions in late 2021 by the universities of Aberdeen and Cambridge to return individual bronzes to Nigeria, and the possibility of more returns from other British museums in 2022, have deepened the impression that the British Museum is out of step. </p><p class="article__body-text">Officials and museums will drag their feet in France, too. The French government insists that a handful of high-profile returns, to Senegal and the Republic of Benin, should not create a legal precedent leading to further restitution. This is ironic, as it was Emmanuel Macron’s promise in 2017 to return plundered items from colonial times which energised campaigners. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In Africa, artists will strive to seize the opportunities presented by the winds of change blowing through the West. Many worry that processes of restitution have been defined in Europe and North America, with too little input from societies to which artefacts might be returned. One exception, and one of the most significant museum developments of 2022, is the expected opening of the John Randle Centre in the heart of Lagos, which will celebrate Yoruba culture and history. It is named after one of the first Africans to qualify as a doctor in Britain, in 1888. Its architect, Seun Oduwole, says it will be “full of the sounds and images of the marketplace and everyday culture”. Its location is poignant: just across the road from Nigeria’s colonial-era museum, where gloomy galleries and dusty display-cabinets provide a warning of how institutions that fail to move with the times can wither away.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Barnaby Phillips: Author of “Loot: Britain and the Benin Bronzes” (Oneworld)</i><span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2022 under the headline “Returning home”</em></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=TWI&amp;title=Western%20museums%20are%20starting%20to%20return%20colonial-era%20treasures&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-08&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fiq6dnfe61m04tci0m0rd48bgatnpka9q&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
