That was in 1993, more than five years before the two countries came out of the nuclear closet one year ago.</p><p class="article__body-text">And now? The chief spy's gloomy assessment is no doubt still accurate. It is harder to say whether last May's nuclear tests warrant deeper gloom. The tests set in train two contradictory processes. They forced India and Pakistan to own up to their nuclear capabilities, to think hard about nuclear deployment and to talk to each other about ways to reduce the risk of war. That is encouraging. On the other hand, nuclear deterrents are designed not for hopes of peace but for threats of war, however remote. They have a momentum of their own. In a crisis, the risk that nuclear weapons will be used depends as much on the minutiae of methods of deployment, intelligence capabilities and command-and-control systems as on the wisdom of political leaders.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The initiative lies with India. It has more money, more fissile material for making bombs, and more nuclear know-how than Pakistan. Unlike Pakistan, India aspires to be a great power, which means that it may not want its nuclear deterrent to be seen as second-rate in Washington. Most important, the remote threat for which India will design its nuclear arsenal comes not from Pakistan but from China, which has a bigger and more sophisticated nuclear capability than either subcontinental country can aspire to.</p><p class="article__body-text"></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/357/90/sites/default/files/cf_images/19990522/csu069.gif" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="357" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/csu069.gif" srcset="../image/csu069.gif" width="600"/></div><p class="article__body-text">China did almost as much damage to India's self-esteem as India has done to Pakistan's with its invasion in 1962, marching deep into Indian territory and humiliating India's army. Although China pulled back, it still occupies 38,000 square kilometres which India considers its own. China's claim does not end there: its maps show all of Arunachal Pradesh as Chinese, and tiny Sikkim as independent of India. Most irksome has been China's alliance with Pakistan, which gave Pakistan a nuclear capability and China a way of dividing India's energies.</p><p class="article__body-text">More recently, relations have improved. The two countries signed a Peace and Tranquillity Agreement in 1993, and another pact to lessen the risk of clashes along the disputed border in 1996. China has also started leaning less obviously towards Pakistan. With the end of the cold war China, like the United States, began to correct its bias against India. It now hints that Pakistan should accept the <span>UN</span> line of control in Kashmir as the border, the solution most Indians but few Pakistanis would accept. China cannot afford to spoil relations with “our second-biggest neighbour”, says Cheng Ruisheng, once China's ambassador to India and now deputy director of its Centre for International Studies. He calls China's policy in South Asia one of “non-involvement”.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But there are limits. China needs Islamic friends, first of all to curb a separatist movement in Xinjiang, a province with a Muslim majority which some analysts consider more dangerous to China than Tibet. Islamic friends are also handy for making America rethink projects like the proposed “theatre missile defence” for Taiwan and Japan. There is a hawkish school in India that scents malicious intent behind China's professions of goodwill. Brahma Chellaney, convenor of the government's national security advisory group, castigates China for refusing to provide maps that indicate the “line of actual control” along the border. Indians think that China is the brains behind Pakistan's instant ripostes to Indian nuclear and missile tests. And last May's nuclear blasts were a setback from which Sino-Indian relations are only now recovering.</p><p class="article__body-text">India's quarrels with China have nothing like the explosive power of the dispute over Kashmir. India now has military parity along the border with China, which makes war even less likely. Yet it is for war with China that India's nuclear planners must prepare. Their tricky task is to arm India against its bigger neighbour without provoking an arms race with the smaller one.</p><h2>How many nukes keep you safe?</h2><p class="article__body-text">India has not said much about what its nuclear arsenal will look like. There are doubts about whether India has the capacity to put a nuclear warhead on a missile that would carry it to China. Some scientists think last May's tests did not yield enough information to be sure, a suspicion flatly denied by Indian officials. If true, however, it would mean that India would need further nuclear tests to develop a nuclear deterrent that would threaten China. Since it has already declared a moratorium on further testing, that would be politically costly, even if the election delays the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p><p class="article__body-text">The two pillars of its strategy are a “minimum credible deterrent” and a doctrine of “no first use” of nuclear weapons. It is developing missiles that can take a nuclear warhead far enough to threaten Chinese population centres. Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser, says India will not seek nuclear parity with China, which has a medium-sized arsenal. Yet, for its deterrent to be credible, it needs nuclear weapons in sufficient numbers, and sufficiently dispersed across the country, to enable them to survive a first strike and cause “unacceptable damage” to the aggressor. Mr Mishra says that India knows, but is not saying, how many it needs and how they will be deployed.</p><p class="article__body-text"></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/320/170/90/sites/default/files/cf_images/19990522/csu996.gif" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="170" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/csu996.gif" srcset="../image/csu996.gif" width="320"/></div><p class="article__body-text">Everyone else has to guess, and the guesses are all over the place. V.R. Raghavan, a former director-general of military operations now working at the Delhi Policy Group, a think-tank, reckons that since the attacker will know where the missiles are, India will need a lot of them to ensure that enough survive. And to make the threat credible, the warheads would have to be ready for immediate launch.</p><p class="article__body-text">This is the sort of deterrent that the United States, for one, devoutly hopes India will not build. It requires infallible command-and-control systems to ensure the weapons are not launched accidentally or in panic. Non-Indian strategists are, perhaps unfairly, sceptical about India's capacity to control nuclear weapons on a hair trigger. “If you say they have to be ready to go and have to be dispersed, you have to trust more and more people,” notes Gregory Jones, an analyst at the <span>RAND</span> Institute in California. “The Indian prime minister [Indira Gandhi] was assassinated by her own hand-picked guards.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Not everyone thinks India needs such an elaborate armoury. C. Raja Mohan, a well-informed correspondent for the<em> Hindu</em>, a daily newspaper, thinks India can get away with relatively few warheads stored well away from any border, which would be coupled to missiles only after a nuclear attack. India would need more time to counter-attack, but the nukes would be less likely to go off without deliberation. That is the sort of “non-deployed weaponised deterrent” Pakistan has in mind. But its policy depends on what India does. Whatever that may be, “Pakistan will have to come up with a matching response,” says Rifaat Hussain, a professor at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. A top Indian official says that “depending on talks with Pakistan, there is flexibility” on how India deploys its nukes.</p><h2>Let's talk</h2><p class="article__body-text">Such talks will be one of several simultaneous conversations between India and Pakistan, all with the object of reducing the risk of war. Most components of this “composite and integrated dialogue” have nothing directly to do with nuclear weapons. They are about things like fostering trade, settling border and water disputes, and ending a tiny but ridiculously costly war atop a Himalayan glacier. Progress depends largely on how Kashmir is handled. India wants normal relations with Pakistan as quickly as possible; Pakistan thinks being too matey will mean surrendering to the status quo. Fortunately both sides have agreed to keep nuclear issues apart from their argument over Kashmir. When India and Pakistan tested missiles in April, they notified each other in advance, as promised at Lahore.</p><p class="article__body-text">Barring proper peace, India and Pakistan should be able to continue what Ashley Tellis, another boffin, has described as “ugly stability”. He has argued that neither country has a big enough conventional edge over the other to win a reasonably short war. There is, therefore, little temptation for Pakistan to make a grab for Kashmir or for India to invade Pakistan. The fear of nuclear attack makes adventurism even less appealing. To believe in the impossibility of war, however, is to be willing to court the risk.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some academics think that Pakistan has the confidence to back the insurgency in Kashmir only because since the mid-1980s it has had the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. India retaliates only within Kashmir or by firing across the line of control, but it is easy to imagine that a future harder-line government might have other ideas. Pakistan might misinterpret a punitive strike as an attempt to dismember it, and might respond by exploding a small nuclear weapon over an Indian tank battalion rather than a city. Would India then consider itself released from its no-first-use pledge? Faulty intelligence, mixed signals between governments or within them, or a breakdown in command and control could raise the risk of resorting to nuclear weapons with each step up the ladder.</p><p class="article__body-text">Because nuclear weapons make such miscalculations so costly, they make them less likely. But the risk will remain as long as India and Pakistan are at loggerheads over Kashmir. The issue most likely to provoke war is the one on which least progress was made at Lahore.</p></div></body></html>
