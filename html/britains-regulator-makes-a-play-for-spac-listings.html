Those that have come to Europe have conspicuously swerved the City, choosing Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris or Stockholm instead. On August 10th, in an attempt to change that, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (<small>FCA</small>) loosened its listing rules.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/britains-regulator-makes-a-play-for-spac-listings.mp3" title="Britain’s regulator makes a play for SPAC listings"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>SPAC</small>s provide an unconventional means of taking private companies public. A dealmaker incorporates a shell company and lists it on a stock exchange, raising money from shareholders in order to find a private company worth buying. After finding one, agreeing a price and passing a shareholder vote, the two companies merge. The private company is now public, and the dealmaker is rewarded with a slice of ownership in the merged entity.</p><p class="article__body-text">Until now, Britain’s rules around mergers put investors off. These prevented shareholders from selling their <small>SPAC</small> shares once a merger target had been found but before a full prospectus had been produced. That deprived them of the chance to make an early exit if they objected to the dealmaker’s choice of target. Instead Amsterdam, which has no such prohibitions, became Europe’s <small>SPAC</small> hub. According to Refinitiv, a data provider, <small>SPAC</small>s have raised $3bn there this year, compared with a minuscule $6m in London. (Both are dwarfed by New York’s $110bn.)</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>FCA</small> hopes that removing the ban on share sales will tempt <small>SPAC</small> sponsors to list in Britain rather than the Netherlands. It is not alone. Advisers to the vehicles that applied to list in early 2021 describe the strain it put on Amsterdam’s financial infrastructure. “There were times when the Dutch regulator literally didn’t have enough people to read all the documents in front of them,” says a partner at an American law firm. “At a certain point investors get sick of being kept in a queue that might mess up their market timing.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, the City cannot count on a <small>SPAC</small> frenzy. Jason Manketo of Linklaters, a British law firm, notes that even under the new regime the sponsor of a British <small>SPAC</small> will be forced to abstain from the merger vote. That puts them at the mercy of other shareholders and at a disadvantage compared with much of the rest of Europe, including Amsterdam. Meanwhile, raising capital in sterling to fund pan-European acquisitions introduces currency risk. Avoiding that would restrict the universe to British companies, which seem keener on leaving public markets than joining them. Moreover, many observers suspect the <small>SPAC</small> craze is already petering out. The <small>FCA</small>’s aim is laudable, but its market timing is off. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Finance &amp; economics section of the print edition under the headline "SPACs and the City"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Britain%E2%80%99s%20regulator%20makes%20a%20play%20for%20SPAC%20listings&amp;publicationDate=2021-08-14&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fvelotb8uguf7jtoqn549et6vrj7thl6i&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
