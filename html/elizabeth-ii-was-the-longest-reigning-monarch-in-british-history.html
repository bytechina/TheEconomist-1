He had spent less than a year on the throne. George VI, her father, hung around for considerably longer: dying in 1952, after 15 years as king. Elizabeth, who <a href="/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era">died on September 8th</a>, managed 70 years, longer than not just Edward and George, but any other monarch. </p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="2022_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text"><a href="/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown">Elizabeth</a> advised 15 British prime ministers and met 13 American presidents. During her reign she lent her name to over 600 charitable organisations and owned more than 40<!-- --> Pembrokeshire Welsh Corgi dogs. Along with her consort, Prince Philip—by her side until his death in 2021—she witnessed the transformation of Britain. </p><p class="article__body-text">England’s 43 monarchs since William the Conqueror have lived to an average age of 54. Elizabeth’s father died from complications caused by lung cancer, a disease that is better treated today. Even her great-great-grandmother, Victoria, who lived until the age of 81, spent six years fewer on the throne. </p><p class="article__body-text">The length of Elizabeth’s reign is unlikely to be repeated. The new monarch, Charles III, is 73. He was Britain’s longest-serving heir apparent and is the oldest new monarch in the country’s history. Based on the average life expectancy for a British male his age, he can expect to reign for 12 years. By that time the heir apparent, William, will be 52 and would have to live until he was 122 to reign longer than his grandmother. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body><script>
