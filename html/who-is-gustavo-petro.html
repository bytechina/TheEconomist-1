But Colombia is an outlier in the region. It has never had a leftist leader—until now. On August 7th, Gustavo Petro, a congressman and former guerrilla, will be <a href="./how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia.html">inaugurated as president</a>. He won 11m votes (just over 50%) in an election in June. It was Mr Petro’s third run at the presidency, following defeats in 2010 and 2018. Colombia has been shaken by the covid-19 pandemic and rising poverty, which catalysed two big protests against <a href="./inequality-in-latin-america-is-fuelling-a-new-wave-of-populism.html">inequality</a>. Mr Petro owes some of his success to these demonstrations, which spurred many young and apolitical people to vote. Who is Colombia’s new leader, and what is his vision for the country?</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Petro has long fancied himself a revolutionary. In 1977, as a 17-year-old, he joined the April 19th Movement, a nationalist guerrilla group known by its acronym M19. Unlike the FARC and other peasant guerillas, M19 was an urban movement mostly made up of educated youths. Mr Petro chose Aureliano as his <i>nom de guerre</i>, after Colonel Aureliano Buendía, a character from “One Hundred Years of Solitude”, a novel by Gabriel García Márquez. Like Colonel Aureliano, who believes he is predestined to liberate his country from conservative elites, Mr Petro became known for his zeal. By the age of 23 he had already led 500 slum-dwellers to occupy land owned by priests in the impoverished outskirts of Bogotá, the capital.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Petro was in jail for allegedly storing weapons when M19 performed its most infamous act. In 1985 around 30 members stormed the Supreme Court. Half of the court’s 24 judges were killed in the ensuing crossfire after the army intervened; nearly 100 other people also died. This episode has been touted repeatedly by Mr Petro’s critics during election campaigns to cast doubt on his democratic credentials (though he appears to have taken no part in the event).</p><p class="article__body-text">After M19 demobilised in 1990, Mr Petro worked as an adviser to the assembly that rewrote Colombia’s constitution. The following year he became a congressman for Alianza Democrática, a centre-left party of former guerrillas. In 1994 he left Colombia for a diplomatic posting in Belgium, after a failed bid for the Senate and because he had received his first death threat. Several former M19 members had been assassinated. On his return he was re-elected to Congress, where he became renowned for calling out corruption and exposing links between politicians and right-wing paramilitary groups. He was less successful as mayor of Bogotá from 2012 to 2015. He had a reputation as a difficult boss and was briefly suspended after mismanaging the municipal takeover of a private rubbish-collection service.</p><p class="article__body-text">As president-elect Mr Petro has signalled a different tack. He still harbours some revolutionary spirit: during the campaign he promised to provide all unemployed Colombians—11% of the workforce—with a state job if they cannot find work in the private sector. He pledged to prohibit new licences for oil and gas exploration, even though extractive industries make up around half of Colombia’s exports. But much of his idealism is now tempered with pragmatism. He vowed under oath not to expropriate businesses or property. And he has picked José Antonio Ocampo, a moderate who is sceptical about offering state jobs to the unemployed, as his finance minister, to serve alongside several other centrist ministers (though he has yet to fill around half of the 20 cabinet positions). Since June, Mr Petro has focused on building support among the established parties in Congress. Most have promised to back him, which may give him the majority he needs to pass reforms. The rebel has possibly become a peacemaker. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist </i>explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-is-the-american-right-obsessed-with-viktor-orban.html">Why is the American right obsessed with Viktor Orban?</a><br/><a href="./will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger.html">Will the grain deal between Russia and Ukraine reduce global hunger?</a><br/><a href="./the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves.html">The increase in simultaneous heatwaves</a></p></div></body></html>
