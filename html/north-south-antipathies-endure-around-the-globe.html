For that prosperous but quarrelsome kingdom is a fine place to see, in miniature, some of the large forces that shape human events around the world. Notably, pocket-sized Belgium is home to an unusually severe case of north-south antipathy. In my near quarter-century as a foreign reporter in four continents, one quirk of human nature has kept cropping up. People love to judge, mock or distrust those who live either above or below them on a map.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/north-south-antipathies-endure-around-the-globe.mp3" title="North-south antipathies endure around the globe"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Formally, Belgium’s splits are linguistic, with its 11.5m people mostly shared between a Dutch-speaking north and a French-speaking south. In reality, language is clearly seen as a badge of tribal belonging. In both Dutch-speaking Flanders and Francophone Wallonia, it is common to hear people declare that the country’s linguistic border—which runs from east to west, dividing the capital, Brussels—is nothing less than the frontier between the Germanic and the Latin worlds.</p><p class="article__body-text">The stereotypes are harsh. As northerners, the Flemish are called hardworking, dour and thrifty, a race of early-to-bed merchants and farmers, inhabiting a land of flat cabbage fields and drab coastal lowlands. As southerners, the Walloons are deemed wily, lazy and corrupt: a race of drinkers and dreamers, faded gentry and public servants employed in vast numbers by a bloated patronage system. Flemish nationalists have little sympathy for French-speaking coal and steel towns once among Europe’s richest, but now sunk in post-industrial blight. In Flanders the grumble is that Walloons—who in the 19th and 20th century lorded it over their Flemish neighbours—are too arrogant and welfare-addicted to learn Dutch and move to their country’s dynamic north.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">For outsiders, it can be confounding to see such animosity crammed into so narrow a space. It is just 222km (138 miles) from Belgium’s northernmost town, Meerle, to Torgny in its far south, or less than the distance from New York to Boston. The same chilly grey skies hang over Flemish and Walloon towns. Yet to hear nationalists on each side talk, their country encompasses Europe’s extremes, as if a tiny Prussia shares a border with a colder Sicily. Belgians invoke long-ago events to explain the puzzle. In 1921, a historian, Emile Cammaerts, traced his country’s divisions back to fifth-century wars that saw pagan Frankish tribes from the Germanic north attack Christian Belgo-Romans in the south, only to be stopped by an impenetrable physical barrier: the Silva Carbonaria, a long-vanished forest that ran along the line of today’s linguistic frontier.</p><p class="article__body-text">North-south antipathies are much more than a cultural curiosity. The euro crisis of 2009-12 began as a row about European banking rules and government debt. As a Brussels-based columnist, the beat became a blur of emergency summits, as the flashing blue lights of motorcades ferried European leaders to another late-night meeting before markets opened the next day. For all the focus on bail-out funds and fiscal discipline, it became clear that a less technical question was also in play: namely, did north and south Europeans like each other enough to share a currency? German and Dutch newspapers talked angrily of “Club Med” countries in Europe’s south, where—they charged—tax-dodging layabouts retire at 55. Gloomy Eurocrats cited the fables of Jean de La Fontaine, imagining priggish northern ants condemning profligate southern grasshoppers to starve.</p><p class="article__body-text">To be sure, the wealthiest and most productive regions of the European Union are mostly in its north and west, with poverty found in the south and ex-communist east. International surveys of corruption rate Denmark, Finland and Sweden among the cleanest countries in the world. Among western <small>EU</small> countries, Greece and Italy fare less well, and former eastern-bloc ones worst of all.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Over the years, however, I have noticed a phenomenon that cannot be explained by international league tables. Within many countries, strikingly similar north-south stereotypes crop up time and again. Such prejudices are often defended by references to climate, topography and history. Northerners are hailed for hard work and thrift. Northern agriculture is praised for its efficiency, which is often linked to an early abolition of feudalism creating lots of small farms owned and worked by sturdy, self-reliant yeomen. Southern regions are deemed friendlier but blighted by clannish corruption and idleness. If southern farms are less productive, harsher weather is only one explanation. Another involves the legacy of vast estates on which hard-pressed, semi-literate peasants laboured well into the 20th century.</p><p class="article__body-text">The really startling detail is how often these stereotypes reset at national borders. Start in the southern Netherlands. According to common prejudice, the Dutch see their Flemish-Belgian neighbours as living an agreeably soft life, filled with fine food and drink (though almost any cuisine looks tasty from the Netherlands, where a business lunch may consist of cheese sandwiches and a glass of buttermilk). Cross the border into Belgian Flanders though, and national stereotypes place you in Germanic northern Europe. Keep driving into French-speaking Wallonia and Belgians reckon you have hit the south. But head across the international border into France, and—by common consent—you are back in a region that is unmistakably northern. Fans of France’s far north praise the locals as generous, earthy and plain-spoken. But the landscape is often bleak, with run-down industrial towns and seemingly deserted villages of grey houses with closed shutters. Head farther into France, past central regions called snooty though prosperous, and the lavender fields and hillside olive groves of the south are reached. Popular French prejudice credits southerners with knowing how to enjoy life in a hot, sunny land, but also accuses them of idleness and dishonesty.</p><h2>A change of perspective</h2><p class="article__body-text">Cross into northern Spain, and the clichés reverse. The north is cold and severe. Galicians are melancholic and Catalans proud and a bit miserly. The great bourgeois cities of the north, like Barcelona, look down on a backward south deemed too fond of fairs and fiestas to get anything done. To many Spaniards, these stereotypes are common sense: a reflection of real-world physical differences. But there is a hitch. Look at a map, and it becomes clear that one person’s north is another’s south. Take supposedly cold, northerly Barcelona. It lies some way south of the sun-baked, southern French city of Marseille, and enjoys almost the same climate.</p><p class="article__body-text">A similar reset may be experienced in Italy. By common consent, northern Italy is business-minded and a bit unfriendly; the south is Mafia-infested, inefficient and poor. Within Italy, regional stereotypes are matched by real-world differences: much about life is harsher in the south, from the climate to crime. Yet on a map of Europe, distinctively northern Italy is not in the north. Indeed haughty, handsome Florence lies on a lower latitude than Avignon, in the southern French region of Provence.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Some nasty prejudices lurk. The idea that warm places are lazy is impossible to separate from long-debunked theories of racial superiority, seeking to explain why white Europeans conquered African, American and Asian colonies with such brutal ease. Over the years, north-western Europeans came up with self-serving theories to explain why Providence had ordained that they should run the world. They boasted that their climate was just bracing enough to inspire men to industry, whether that meant weaving fine clothes or building cities of brick and stone, without being so cold as to make agriculture impossible. They scorned hot places where fewer clothes are necessary, and food supposedly falls from trees. In fact, the link between temperate weather and invention is distinctly weak. Until well into the Middle Ages, northern and western Europe were backwaters. Whether studying the history of mathematics, medicine or literature, civilisation flowed from east to west, carried from the Mediterranean basin, the Islamic world and China to damp, chilly places like Germany or the British isles.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the 20th century, the long shadow of Max Weber and his claims to identify a distinctly Protestant work ethic loom over any discussion of productivity. I admit to scepticism, born of many years working in America, whose diversity mocks any attempt to claim economic dynamism and innovation for Protestantism, or any other creed. Nor, for that matter, does modern America lend itself to simple north-south generalisations, for all the clichés about taciturn, diligent New Englanders and drawling, bourbon-sipping southerners. For when the “South” is used to stand for racial inequality, rural poverty and prejudice, that means the old Confederacy. True, the legacies of the slave era are shockingly long-lasting. During the covid-19 pandemic, a comparison of states with high and low vaccination rates resembles a Civil War map. To this day, voting patterns in the rural Midwest correlate with areas settled from the north by demobilised Union soldiers, and from the south by defeated Confederate veterans.</p><p class="article__body-text">Elsewhere, however, wave after wave of internal migration and immigration have redrawn American maps, many times over. The far rural north of Florida votes like Alabama and Louisiana. But the rest of the state is a melting pot in miniature, from snow-haired Jewish New Yorkers in Palm Beach to Cubans and Venezuelans in Miami, or Puerto Ricans in Orlando. Reporting from the south-western Sunbelt, I met conservative whites who had just migrated to Arizona and Hispanic farmers whose roots in New Mexico predate the founding of the United States. In a restless, continent-sized country, any debate about regional clichés must first answer: which north and which south?</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet north-south stereotypes are more than a European quirk. Vietnam boasts both genuine north-south differences, and stereotypes that draw on harder-to-credit notions about climate and topography. Vietnam’s division from 1955 to 1975 into two warring halves, a communist north and an American-backed south, caused cleavages that were still visible in the mid-1990s. Northern Hanoi was in 1995 an austere place, filled with political slogans and war memorials. The old southern capital of Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City, was already a capitalist boomtown.</p><p class="article__body-text">History explains much of that gap, says Le Hong Hiep, a Vietnam scholar at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. Southern Vietnam, historically a great trading hub, knew only a few years of communist central planning between the American retreat in 1975 and the start of market reforms in the 1980s. Later, returning members of the southern Vietnamese diaspora, especially from America, were a source of investment and entrepreneurial energy. In contrast, the north spent decades as a communist, wartime economy.</p><p class="article__body-text">Prodded during a Zoom interview to describe regional stereotypes, Mr Le at first demurs, for he is a serious academic. Then, as he is also a genial sort, he plays along. By reputation, he says, northerners are more interested in politics and jobs in government, but southerners are drawn to commerce. Northern winters are very cold, he goes on. And because that is hard on farmers, life as an official is an appealing alternative. In the hot, tropical south, there is only a dry season and a rainy season. “They have an abundance of fruit and fish and rice, especially in the Mekong delta. So people don’t have to work as hard. So they are maybe a bit lazy,” says Mr Le.</p><p class="article__body-text">That is fascinating, I tell Mr Le from my office in Beijing, but also puzzling. For almost identical stereotypes—involving harsh winters that drive northerners into government, while southerners enjoy a life of ease—are applied to different bits of China. And here is another thing: on a map, China’s hot, southern, commercially minded regions lie above your frigid north. Mr Le pauses. “What is winter for Vietnamese people is maybe summer for other people,” he laughs.</p><p class="article__body-text">China is a handy place to explore such mysteries. To generalise, the Chinese relish stereotypes. Indeed, sensitive foreigners are best off avoiding any discussion of regional, national, ethnic, racial and religious differences when in China, unless they want to hear all about the athleticism of black people and the cleverness of Jews.</p><p class="article__body-text">Food, a beloved topic, is often linked to regional character. By common consent, China’s north is shaped by wheat-growing and noodle-eating, but its south is influenced by its staple crop, rice. Some years ago American and Chinese researchers published a “rice theory”, after finding higher levels of individualism among students surveyed in north China, and more group loyalty among southern ones. They saw a link with the traditional culture of rice farmers, who must pool labour and co-operate when flooding paddy-fields. In contrast, wheat farmers mostly rely on rain and need not work with neighbours, for theirs is not as labour-intensive a crop.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Dongxing, a coastal town on China’s border with Vietnam, lies 2,500km south of Beijing. A balmy spot in the far-southern province of Guangxi, its population is swelled each year by tourists and long-term visitors from northern China, especially retirees fleeing freezing winters. It is a fertile place in which to harvest north-south stereotypes. The nearest Vietnamese city, Mong Cai, lies just across the Beilun river, a sluggish, brown creek 50 metres wide. It is so close that, with the naked eye, it is possible to see Vietnamese border guards lounging in folding chairs on the far bank, fishing rods at their sides. Before covid-19 controls closed the nearby Friendship Bridge, Vietnamese tourists arrived each day. A trader in teak chopping boards, who will give only his surname, Deng, calls folk from northern China well-educated but standoffish. They are better suited to officialdom than business, he mutters. A veteran traveller to both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, he calls southern Vietnamese food tastier, and southern women prettier. Mr Deng’s pro-southern chauvinism is ironic, given that northern Vietnam is the source of the wood on which his business depends. It is illegal to cut large teak trees in China, he explains, but luckily Vietnam does not enforce laws well.</p><p class="article__body-text">Belgium feels a long way from the muddy, jungly riverbanks of Dongxing. But the conversations in this humid Chinese town are oddly familiar. As in Belgium, the proximity of a proudly northern bit of the world, a few metres away, in no way shakes the locals’ conviction that here, they are southerners in every respect.</p><h2>The upside down</h2><p class="article__body-text">Delightfully, north-south clichés reverse on the far side of the equator—a discovery I made during a posting to Australia. To meet starched establishment types, I headed south, to Melbourne, Adelaide and other genteel cities with mild climates. In contrast, to interview Pauline Hanson, then a fast-rising nativist politician, I flew to Cairns in Queensland’s sweltering north. I found her stirring up alarm about immigration making Australia “a foreign country”, by which she seemed to mean less white. “I’m not anti-immigrant, but we don’t want to be Asianised,” she explained. “We’ve got crime with machetes now.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Regional generalisations suggest some larger truths about human nature. For one thing, people are hard-wired to make relative judgments: defining lives as harsh or lazy in comparison with those lived by neighbours. Also, human beings are overwhelmingly interested by their own societies. That is why so few notice, or care, if their country’s supposedly hot, lazy south sits atop another nation’s chilly, businesslike north. This is no cause for dismay. If over two decades on the road teaches anything, it is that the world is not a machine whose workings can be explained with the laws of physics. Foreign affairs more closely resemble a noisy, ceaseless family argument that outsiders can never fully understand. Faithfully recording that cacophony, and trying to extract some sense from it, is the foreign correspondent’s job, at every latitude. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><small>ILLUSTRATIONS: STEVEN GREGOR</small></p><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/christmas-style-fixes/index.html"></iframe></figure><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Christmas Specials section of the print edition under the headline "A world of two halves"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=North-south%20antipathies%20endure%20around%20the%20globe&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fafqs7jr56phmf8grpapaolpd6jm2bnci&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
