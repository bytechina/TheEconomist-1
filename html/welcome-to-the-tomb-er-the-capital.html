No wonder, said those who loathe the drab, Soviet-built town in the windswept north of the country. Its name has now been changed to Astana, which simply means “capital”. Much more appropriate, says the president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, as he prepares to welcome foreign guests to the capital's official opening on June 10th.</p><p class="article__body-text"></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/285/217/90/sites/default/files/cf_images/19980606/cas944.gif" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="217" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/cas944.gif" srcset="../image/cas944.gif" width="285"/></div><p class="article__body-text">What's in a name? Not much. As Akmola, Astana or Tselinograd (Virgin Lands City), its name when this Central Asian country was part of the Soviet Union, the climate remains appalling: winters of 40 below and summers of stifling heat and swarms of curiously large mosquitoes. It is no wonder that Astana's new arrivals, mainly government officials and a few businessmen, have yet to develop an affection for the place.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Although the Kazakhs grumble about Almaty, the capital it replaces, with its smog and risk of earthquakes, they are used to it and now speak of its virtues. Most government officials sent to Astana have held on to their flats in Almaty and have left their families there. On Friday evenings, the flights from Astana to Almaty tend to be packed.</p><p class="article__body-text">New capitals seldom win instant affection. Pakistanis reacted with similar scorn when their capital was moved from the historic city of Karachi to characterless Islamabad. Mr Nazarbaev seems confident that the Kazakhs will eventually come to accept the change. The government points out that the new capital is far from troublesome Afghanistan and Tajikistan. But the main motive for the move seems to be a desire to tie in the north, populated mostly by ethnic Slavs, some of whom feel more attached to Russia.</p><p class="article__body-text">Astana, a city of 300,000, has plenty of room to grow; indeed it is growing by the day. Building goes on around the clock. Any company investing there gets a generous tax break. The telecoms system in Astana is now better than any other in Central Asia.</p><p class="article__body-text">The full cost of creating the new capital has not been made public, although Mr Nazarbaev says that most of the money will come from foreign investors. But no details are given to explain how or why. Kazakhstan is a poor country, though getting richer, and salaries and pensions are seldom paid on time. For many Kazakhs, it is galling to see millions of dollars poured into the unloved new capital. In December, when the president opened Astana's splendid new indoor tennis courts, many of his countrymen were shivering through a winter without any gas or electricity. </p></div></body></html>
