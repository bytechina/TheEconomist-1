Some hope that the apparent winner, Xiomara Castro, will help them build a country they no longer wish to escape. Preliminary results suggest that Ms Castro, of the leftist Libre party, has won the presidency, ending 12 years of rule by the National Party. With her allies, she may secure a majority in Congress, too. Ms Castro, the wife of a former president, Manuel “Mel” Zelaya, rose to prominence by leading protests against his ouster in a coup in 2009. Her win is part of a backlash against organised crime in Honduras, and against incumbents across Latin America.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The poll was peaceful. At 68%, turnout was the highest for over a decade. Fears of a repeat of the fraud and violence seen in 2017 proved unfounded. Back then at least 29 people were killed when President Juan Orlando Hernández was re-elected in murky circumstances—and after the Supreme Court had changed the constitution to allow him to run for a second term. <span>Ms Castro will be the first female president in the Northern Triangle</span>.</p><p class="article__body-text">She will have a lot to do. Mr Hernández, one of the most unpopular leaders in Latin America, is accused of having turned Honduras into a narco-state. In 2019 he was implicated in a trial in the United States that found his brother guilty of drug trafficking. (He denies any involvement.) The country is the second-poorest in the region, after Haiti. In 2019 around half the population of 10m lived on less than $5.50 per day. The covid-19 pandemic has made matters worse. And although the murder rate has fallen by half since 2011, it remains the fifth-highest in the world.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Castro talks about rebuilding democracy, creating a fairer economy and getting rid of corruption. She says her government will work for poorer people, such as teachers and farmers, rather than elites. Some promises, like selling the presidential plane, should be relatively easy to keep (although Mexico’s populist president, attempting the same gimmick in 2018, could not find a buyer). But other ideas are either vague or improbable.</p><p class="article__body-text">For example, she has promised on the first day of her presidency to organise a vote for a body to write a new constitution. Lester Ramírez of the Association for a More Just Society, an <small>NGO</small>, reckons she may delay these plans and focus on job creation instead. Ms Castro also says she will tackle corruption by inviting in a <small>UN</small>-backed commission to come into the country, along the lines of the one in Guatemala which helped prosecute two former presidents and numerous officials. Tiziano Breda of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, suspects that donors may be loth to back such a body, after the one in Guatemala was booted out by the government in 2019.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">It is also unclear how her government will be able to afford to create more generous social programmes or support small businesses, particularly as Ms Castro has pledged to cut fuel duty and not raise other taxes. Public debt is expected to reach nearly 60% of <small>GDP</small> this year.</p><p class="article__body-text">Her clout will also depend on the final make-up of Congress and her ability to build relationships with the civil service, which is stuffed with National Party allies, and the army, which ousted her husband. Both are uncertain. Mr Hernández may also use his final month in office to appoint loyalists to key positions.</p><p class="article__body-text">But if Ms Castro can achieve some of what she has promised, it would be a welcome change in a region that has been plagued by democratic backsliding. Indeed, she appears slightly more pragmatic than when she first ran for president, in 2013. She toned down recent investor-spooking campaign pledges, such as to boost state-owned enterprises. She has also been less vocal about ending recognition of Taiwan in favour of China.</p><p class="article__body-text">Concerns that Ms Castro is a front for her husband and will model Honduras on Venezuela are overblown, thinks Mr Breda. Her husband had a close relationship with Hugo Chávez and Libre is part of an alliance with other regional leftist groups, including Cuba’s Communist Party. But although she responded to congratulations from Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s current despot, she ignored those from Daniel Ortega, the despot in next-door Nicaragua.</p><p class="article__body-text">To build trust with the United States, Ms Castro will have to play up her pragmatism. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has been struggling to find partners in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to tackle migration, has said it hopes to work with Ms Castro. Both countries need good allies at the moment.</p><p class="article__body-text"><em><strong><span>Correction</span> (December 2nd 2021):</strong> An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Ms Castro will be the first female president in Central America.
