The grudges, alliances, colour and kitsch—and most of all the peaceful spectacle watched in dozens of countries—represent both the best and sometimes the silliest of the prosperous modern continent. One of the rivalries it captures is among Europe’s languages. A recent heat in Spain, to help choose the song to be sent to the finals in May, exhibited another kind of linguistic squabble: the dominance of national languages over misunderstood regional ones.</p><p class="article__body-text">Spanish viewers were treated to Tanxugueiras, a Galician trio, and their song “Terra”. The presenters scored their first outrage with Galician viewers when, in what seemed a scripted line, one said (by way of introduction): “Belgium has sent a song in an invented language, not once but twice.” Her colleague jokily clarified: “But our next candidates to represent us have not invented anything.” Instead, she explained, the song was written in one of the regional languages that have joint official status in their parts of the country. It was mostly in Galician, spoken in Spain’s north-west, but included a repeated line (“there are no borders”) in Basque, Catalan, Asturian, Spanish and Spanish Sign Language.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The crowd loved the tune; Tanxugueiras won the viewers’ vote. The two international judges were also taken by the trio. But not so the Spanish ones, whose votes swung the victory to another song (in Spanish). The double insult of the presenters’ banter and the judges overriding the popular choice set Galician social media alight. Their language, Galicians complained, is in no way “invented”. A descendant of Latin, it is every bit as old as Spanish. Some speculated that the Spanish judges simply couldn’t countenance sending a song that is not in Spanish to the final.</p><p class="article__body-text">The quip about invented languages probably derived more from ignorance than from malice. Europe is full of regional languages whose status seems hazy to those who think a country’s only “real” language is the official, national one. Local varieties are called dialect, argot, patois, jargon, slang or similar, even though linguists are adamant that some are distinct languages. The linguist’s most common test for these variants is whether close neighbours can understand them. If doing so is difficult or impossible, they are languages, not dialects.</p><p class="article__body-text">But another criterion is entirely political: does the language have a flag, borders and a state? If not, in many minds it exists in a kind of netherworld of not-really-languages. Galician may have official status in its home region, but elsewhere in Spain it is often seen as a curiosity rather than a language as “real” as Spanish.</p><p class="article__body-text">Galician, as it happens, presents another problem. Lots of people consider it and Portuguese to be one and the same, a debate covered in a new book (in Portuguese) by Marco Neves of <small>NOVA</small> University Lisbon. Mr Neves thinks Galician can be considered the parent of Portuguese. But whether Galician is distinct is a different question from whether it is “real”. If, in fact, it is actually Portuguese—and should be called Galician-Portuguese, a name some people prefer—then it is one of the world’s biggest languages, spoken by hundreds of millions. If it is separate—and many Portuguese can struggle to understand it, despite deep similarities—then it is a unique regional language. But in either case, it no more deserves to be compared to made-up mumbo-jumbo than does Spanish itself.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Eurovision’s nominating contests are continuing. France, to its credit, has in the past sent entries in regional languages (Corsican and Breton). Ukraine won in 2016 with an entry sung partly in Crimean Tatar. But that sort of recognition is a rarity. Europe has many languages—Catalan and Cornish, Sardinian and Sorbian, Frisian and Friulian—which between them have tens of millions of speakers, and are in theory protected by both national constitutions and a European charter, but which must constantly jostle for attention. The more their advocates seek recognition, the more some speakers of national languages treat them as obsessives or cranks.</p><p class="article__body-text">The song contest has, rather famously, not only featured songs in fully elaborated invented languages, but winners with titles such as “Boom Bang-a-Bang”, “Ding-a-Dong” and “Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley”. Spain itself took the crown in 1968 with “La, la, la”. The air of absurdity would not be heightened by more countries sending songs in Europe’s venerable minority languages.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline "Escape from La La land"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20language%20without%20a%20flag%20and%20a%20state%20is%20still%20a%20language&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-12&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ftv58tjd4bs4mad4novoenit2af6g4f9j&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
