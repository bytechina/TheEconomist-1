Peru did it in June last year. Chile did it in December. <a href="./brazils-presidential-election-in-october-will-be-about-the-economy.html">Brazil</a> is likely to do it in October. May 29th was Colombia’s turn, when voters plumped for the two presidential candidates who most clearly represent change. <a href="./how-gustavo-petro-would-change-colombia-if-he-wins-the-presidential-election.html">Gustavo Petro</a>, pictured left, is a former guerrilla who got more than 40% of votes (around 8.5m). Rodolfo Hernández, pictured right, is a millionaire who was little-known a few months ago but has fired up devotees with his rants on TikTok. He won 28%. The <a data-tegid="1jdg651dgnlgssj0uf3lj9tl4q45i1uq" href="./a-leftist-ex-guerrilla-and-a-populist-face-off-for-the-colombian-presidency.html">run-off is on June 19th</a>.</p><p class="article__body-text">Colombia has long been something of an anomaly in Latin America, a continent where many voters still have a soft spot for <i>caudillos</i>. With the exception of a brief period of strongman rule under Álvaro Uribe Velez, who was president from 2002 to 2010, its politics tend to be moderate. For decades, left-wing extremism has been unpopular, as Colombians have related it with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (<small>farc</small>), a Marxist guerrilla group. Governments have favoured strong ties with America. Investors flocked to Colombia. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Growth has been robust in recent years: income per head rose from $4,000 in 2000 to $6,400 before the pandemic. However, inequality is extreme. Few Colombians pay taxes. Discontent fuelled violent protests in 2019 and 2021. Largely thanks to covid-19, an additional 2.8m Colombians (out of a population of 51m) fell below a $38-a-month poverty threshold in 2020. Since then, Colombia’s economy has rebounded more quickly than those of other countries in Latin America, with <small>gdp</small> growing by 10% last year. But a <a href="./peace-at-last-in-colombia.html">peace deal with the <small>farc</small></a> in 2016 was poorly implemented by Iván Duque, the outgoing president, and parts of the country are still violent. </p><p class="article__body-text">Neither Mr Petro nor Mr Hernández looks capable of tackling these complex issues. Both were unimpressive mayors. When Mr Petro ran Bogotá, the capital, he had a reputation for falling out with his staff. He was briefly suspended after mismanaging the municipal takeover of a private rubbish-collection service. Mr Hernández’s record is worse. As mayor of Bucaramanga, a medium-sized city, from 2016 to 2019 he was suspended three times: after slapping a colleague; calling an official corrupt without evidence; and for violating election laws by campaigning for his chosen successor. An engineer by training, he promised to build 20,000 homes for the poor. None materialised. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Petro has moderated his tone of late, but his policies remain radical. He wants to increase tariffs, renegotiate trade deals and guarantee public-sector jobs for all of the unemployed (around 11% of the labour force). He also wants to end new oil and gas exploration, despite extractive industries accounting for over half of exports.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Hernández is also big on promises and poor on realism. His proposals, often relayed over social media, include such edifying lines as “Fuck fracking”. He, too, has a protectionist streak. He talks often about corruption, and says he would want to have a daily press conference in which he names and shames allegedly dirty politicians. As it happens, he is due to be tried for corruption in July. He denies wrongdoing.</p><p class="article__body-text">Colombia is taking a step into the unknown. Either candidate could destabilise a country that was on track for at least modest success. Colombians need not look far to see the harm that demagoguery can do. The right-wing sort has marred Brazil since 2019; the left-wing sort has <a href="./21806197.html">wrecked Venezuela</a>. If elected, Mr Petro may be slightly more likely than Mr Hernández to accept checks and balances. But whoever wins, Colombia’s institutions will have to brace themselves. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div></body></html>
