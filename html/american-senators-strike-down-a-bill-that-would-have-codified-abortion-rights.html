Democratic leadership proposed the largely-symbolic vote in response to a leaked draft of a majority opinion by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in <i>Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation</i>, a case that could overturn <i>Roe v Wade</i>. If the draft reflects the court’s coming ruling, it will then be up to each state to set its <a href="/graphic-detail/2022/05/03/a-supreme-court-leak-portends-tighter-abortion-laws-in-america">own policy on abortion</a>. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">What might they do? <a href="/graphic-detail/2022/05/07/religion-not-gender-is-the-best-predictor-of-views-on-abortion">Polling may offer a guide</a>. <i>The Economist</i> trained a statistical model of abortion attitudes among more than 18,000 respondents to surveys conducted with YouGov, an online pollster, over the past year. YouGov offered participants the chance to pick between four responses: abortion should always be legal; abortion should be legal with some restrictions (such as for minors, or late in a pregnancy); a ban on all procedures except when the mother’s life is threatened; or a full ban, without exceptions. (For the purpose of comparison, we have taken a position on the bill to be analogous to a view on the third option.)</p><p class="article__body-text">A statistical technique known as multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) was then used to assess the relationship between respondents’ attitudes to abortion and their demography and geography, estimating the share of the population in each state that favoured each of the four potential abortion policies. This suggested that adults in 38 states and the District of Columbia supported either unrestricted access to abortion or bans only on late-term procedures. Residents of California and Massachusetts appeared to be the most liberal. In only 12 states, according to this method, was a majority of the population opposed to abortion. Arkansans and West Virginians appeared to favour restrictions on all but emergency procedures. In no state, according to this polling, did people wish to see an outright ban on abortion. </p><p class="article__body-text">Taken together, this means that 27 senators from 16 states voted against the will of a majority of their constituents. The polling suggests this divergence is starkest in Wisconsin. Ron Johnson, the Republican senator from there who faces re-election in mid-term elections in November, voted against the legislation on May 11th. Yet 60% of adults in Wisconsin approve of abortion in all or most cases, our modelling shows. Mr Johnson thinks the mismatch is unlikely to matter. Before the vote, he told the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that outlawing abortion ​​”might be a little messy for some people, but [it] is not going away”, saying that Wisconsin women who want abortions could drive across the state’s border to Illinois where it will probably remain legal. Republicans in Alaska, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Texas also voted against what polling suggests their constituents would prefer. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For a look behind the scenes of our data journalism, sign up to <a href="/offthecharts/">Off the Charts</a>, our weekly newsletter</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Editor’s note (May 12th 2022): </b><i>This article was updated to make clear an assumption by our data team made for purposes of comparison.</i></p></div></body><script>
