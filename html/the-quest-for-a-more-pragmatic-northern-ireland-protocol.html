Under Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, Great Britain has left the European Union’s single market and customs union. But to avoid a hard north-south border in Ireland, Northern Ireland has, in effect, remained in both. That necessitates border and customs checks between the province and Great Britain instead.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-quest-for-a-more-pragmatic-northern-ireland-protocol.mp3" title="The quest for a more pragmatic Northern Ireland protocol"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The prime minister is now attacking Brussels for its legal purism in enforcing their agreement. His supporters denounce the <small>EU</small>’s colonialism and lack of feel for delicate Northern Irish politics. They have even accused <small>EU</small> leaders of treating the province as if it were no longer a full member of the United Kingdom.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet it was Mr Johnson who chose to negotiate the protocol as the alternative to the loathed “backstop” engineered by Theresa May, his predecessor. This would have kept the entire United Kingdom in a customs union with the <small>EU</small>. The protocol lays down precisely how this alternative arrangement should work, including rules to block movement of chilled meats such as fresh sausages, after a grace period that expires on June 30th.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Johnson knew all this when he triumphantly ratified the protocol, calling it the best of both worlds. It is disingenuous for him to feign outrage today, when Brussels calls for the rules to be implemented, not broken. However much he relishes the political gains from a fight with the <small>EU</small>, for the sake of peace in Ireland and the health of Britain’s most vital commercial relationship, he should compromise—and the <small>EU</small> should go out of its way to help him.</p><p class="article__body-text">An early sign of the potential costs came at the <small>G</small>7 summit in Cornwall, Britain’s post-Brexit coming-out party, which was partly overshadowed by squabbles over the protocol. Mr Johnson signalled that he plans to break the treaty (and, once again, international law) by unilaterally extending the chilled-meats grace period. Brussels meanwhile is insisting that it will invoke its right to retaliate with tariffs.</p><p class="article__body-text">A tariff war over sausages would be an absurdity. The <small>EU</small> runs by law and it fears that Mr Johnson will gradually undermine the entire protocol. But by pressing its case it is playing into his hands, because his poll ratings rise in line with battles with the <small>EU.</small> Even if the law is on its side, the politics are not.</p><p class="article__body-text">A compromise is available. The <small>EU</small> could be more creative in assessing whether goods going to Northern Ireland are really about to cross into its single market. It is already easing the movement of guide dogs and medicines, and the single market has just survived six months of free-flowing British sausages.</p><p class="article__body-text">Although the <small>EU</small> does not trust the British government, Mr Johnson could help by offering a concession of his own by promising to observe, for a limited period, <small>EU</small> food-safety standards, as Switzerland does. That would eliminate 80% of checks in the Irish Sea and, moreover, allow beef, lamb and fisheries exports from Britain to the <small>EU</small> to resume.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Some argue against this, pointing to a British ideological allergy to any alignment with <small>EU</small> rules. Yet the British government is sticking to the <small>EU</small>’s veterinary standards—indeed, it is promising to exceed them. Others say that regulatory divergence with the <small>EU</small> may be needed to secure a free-trade deal with America, a big food exporter. Yet at the <small>G</small>7 summit Mr Biden promised that this would not be the case. In any event, there is no prospect of a transatlantic free-trade deal for several years.</p><p class="article__body-text">Other free-trade deals with, say, Australia would still be possible while sticking to <small>EU</small> rules. Switzerland has a deal with China and, unlike <small>EU</small> countries, can import hormone-treated beef if it is labelled. Tellingly, temporary British observance (avoiding the term “alignment”) of the <small>EU</small>’s veterinary standards has been called for by all parties in Northern Ireland, including the new Democratic Unionist leader, Edwin Poots.</p><p class="article__body-text">This scheme would give time for relations with the <small>EU</small> to cool and let negotiators find a more pragmatic approach to Northern Irish trade. That would be wiser than further breaches of international law or the imposition of tariffs. Does Mr Johnson want a fight, or what’s best for the United Kingdom? <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more coverage of matters relating to Brexit, visit our <a href="./page-not-found.html"> Brexit hub</a></em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "Protocol problems"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20quest%20for%20a%20more%20pragmatic%20Northern%20Ireland%20protocol&amp;publicationDate=2021-06-19&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F17qo5l74pirt40j497lmi06fvf048red&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
