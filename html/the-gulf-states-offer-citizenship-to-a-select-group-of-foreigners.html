The Indian expat has done office jobs in Bahrain since the 1990s. They paid well enough to put his kids through school and provide a modest nest-egg. Retirement beckons. Yet he finds the prospect unsettling. It means a one-way ticket back to a place where he has not lived in decades. “I’ll leave a place with all my memories for a country I don’t recognise,” he says.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-gulf-states-offer-citizenship-to-a-select-group-of-foreigners.mp3" title="The Gulf states offer citizenship to a select group of foreigners"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Such stories are common in the Gulf. Of the 59m people who live in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council (<small>GCC</small>), about half are foreigners. Some stay for a few years; others spend entire careers. Almost all, however, arrive with the understanding that they must eventually depart.</p><p class="article__body-text">Gulf states have long bristled at the idea of offering citizenship to expats. Locals fear it would change their national identity. Governments are not keen to extend costly benefits to foreigners. For most foreigners, life in the Gulf involves a string of short-term work visas: cease to be productive, and you cease to be a resident.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This is slowly changing. In January the United Arab Emirates (<small>UAE</small>) announced that certain foreigners, such as doctors, inventors and scientists, could be nominated for citizenship. Saudi Arabia said in November that it had naturalised an undisclosed number of expats. Most Gulf states now offer long-term residence visas that do not require work. A new scheme in the <small>UAE</small> allows expats to retire in the country instead of returning home.</p><p class="article__body-text">None of this is a “path to citizenship” as many liberal democracies would define it. Only an elite group is eligible: a talented scientist could become an Emirati citizen, but not the janitor who cleans his lab. The numbers are tiny. The <small>UAE</small> will naturalise only around 1,000 people a year, or 0.01% of its population. Long-term visas are tied to wealth, with requirements for income or investment that exclude most workers.</p><p class="article__body-text">Still, even these small steps break a long-held taboo. In 2013 Sultan al-Qassemi, a member of the ruling family in Sharjah, part of the <small>UAE</small>, published an op-ed urging the state to naturalise talented foreigners. It caused an uproar. On social media many Emiratis replied with a hashtag that translates as “this writer does not represent me”.</p><p class="article__body-text">The steps raise complicated questions about citizenship and identity in the <small>GCC</small>. Even for native-born <em>khaleejis</em> (Gulf Arabs), citizenship is not a right enjoyed equally. If a Bahraini man marries a foreign woman, his wife may apply for his nationality and his kids automatically receive it. Reverse the sexes, though, and no such rights exist. When a Gulf woman marries a foreigner, their children are typically treated as foreigners. Mothers in Bahrain may sponsor them as dependants until they are 18, renewing their papers every two years; after that, children must secure their own residency or leave. “You can imagine, this issue leads to a lot of complaints,” says Ali al-Dirazi, the head of Bahrain’s state-run human-rights agency.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>UAE</small>’s new citizenship scheme has prompted a rare debate about such things. Jawaher al-Qassemi, the wife of Sharjah’s ruler, posted a short comment on Twitter: “Naturalisation for the children of female citizens. That’s a demand,” she wrote. Other Emiratis voiced similar feelings.</p><p class="article__body-text">Several Gulf states also have populations of so-called <em>bidoon</em> (people “without” papers), who did not register as citizens at independence. Kuwait has at least 100,000 of them. They are broadly excluded from good jobs and social services. Newly minted citizens will receive rights denied to natives for half a century.</p><p class="article__body-text">Foreigners naturalised in the <small>UAE</small> will be free to live and work in a rich country, and to travel on a passport that ranks as one of the world’s most useful. The government is vague as to whether they will enjoy other privileges. Native-born Emiratis receive everything from cheaper mobile-phone plans to interest-free housing loans. Some receive grants of up to 70,000 dirhams ($19,000) when they get married.</p><p class="article__body-text">If rights are unclear, so are responsibilities. Since 2014 Emirati men have been required to perform military service. The law does not say if naturalised citizens (or their descendants) face the same burden—though perhaps not, since there seems to be no requirement that they know Arabic. They will be allowed to keep their original nationality, whereas native-born Emiratis cannot hold a second passport. Some fret the government has created a two-tier model of citizenship.</p><p class="article__body-text">The citizenship law is part of a head-spinning package of reforms implemented by the <small>UAE</small> over the past year. Unmarried couples may now legally live together. Muslims may drink. In November Abu Dhabi, the capital, decided to allow civil marriages for non-Muslims. On December 7th the <small>UAE</small> announced that it would shift the public sector to a Monday-to-Friday work week, from Sunday-to-Thursday, bringing it in sync with most of the world (but out of step with many Arab countries).</p><p class="article__body-text">Much of this simply legalises reality: there are lots of cohabiting singletons and carousing Muslims in Dubai. Yet the changes have come with little public debate in a country where space for criticism is almost non-existent.</p><p class="article__body-text">The same goes for naturalisation schemes. Even before the oil boom, the Gulf’s coastal towns and pilgrimage routes were melting pots. Today their citizenry includes sizeable populations of <em>ajam</em>, whose ancestors hail from Persia, and Afro-Arabs, descendants of East Africans brought to the region as slaves. Diversity was, and is, one of the region’s strengths. To varying degrees, though, locals live apart from foreigners in their midst. Their dress is distinct and they work mostly in the public sector. No one is sure how new citizens will fit into this milieu.</p><p class="article__body-text">Though they have broken a taboo, Gulf rulers have not changed a social compact that treats citizenship as a gift bestowed on worthy subjects. They have just expanded the pool of worthy subjects in order to attract and retain talented foreigners—part of a broader scramble to diversify oily economies. For most foreigners, and for many locals, the path to citizenship will remain blocked. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "A narrow path"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20Gulf%20states%20offer%20citizenship%20to%20a%20select%20group%20of%20foreigners&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-09&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fhtnpr6h8adk7to28vh7oeqqiqv0egf5v&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
