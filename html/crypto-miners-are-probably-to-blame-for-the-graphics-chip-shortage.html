Just as covid-19 brought in-person entertainment to a halt, the cost of graphics processing units (<small>GPU</small>s) needed to run computer games soared. Graphics cards like Nvidia’s <small>RTX</small> 3080, with a suggested price of $699, have fetched up to $2,400. When bricks-and-mortar stores get a few in stock, buyers queue up overnight.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/091%20Graphic%20detail%20-%20Computer%20hardware-f913ad37b6e766fb1a7dac6d3fe5557f.mp3" title="Crypto-miners are probably to blame for the graphics-chip shortage"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Prices for all types of chips have risen of late, for myriad reasons. Silicon wafers are scarce. Manufacturers have suffered disruptions. Scalpers use bots to buy up inventory. Chinese-made chips face American tariffs. And demand for personal computers is the highest since 2010.</p><p class="article__body-text">Nonetheless, data from Keepa, a website that tracks Amazon listings, show that asking prices for <small>GPU</small>s have risen faster than have those for central processing units (<small>CPU</small>s). The data also suggest that miners of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, are to blame for gamers’ woes.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>GPU</small>s and <small>CPU</small>s both perform calculations, but they are used for different purposes. <small>GPU</small>s are specialised chips that excel at matrix algebra, which is required for 3<small>D</small> graphics and machine-learning tasks like translating languages. They are also the best tool for mining Ethereum (though not bitcoin). In contrast, <small>CPU</small>s are more versatile, and handle most everyday operations.</p><p class="article__body-text">In general, chips lose value over time as new, more powerful ones are developed. Technological gains have slowed since the 1990s, but <small>CPU</small>s still obey this trend. For example, a nine-year-old <small>CPU</small> like Intel’s Core i7-3770 sells for a third of its release price.</p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure><iframe data-size="full-width" height="NaN" src="20210619_GDC200_2_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">However, prices for <small>GPU</small>s have risen so much that even geriatric graphics cards, such as <small>AMD</small>’s <small>RX</small>580, have gained value. It was released in 2017 at a suggested price of $229, and is now listed at more than $700.</p><p class="article__body-text">In theory, such appreciation could reflect the growing popularity of gaming and machine learning. However, secondhand market data suggest a different cause.</p><p class="article__body-text">Since 2015 asking prices for six <small>GPU</small>s tracked by Keepa have moved in lockstep with Ethereum’s value. In late 2017 the currency’s first big rally coincided with a surge in listed <small>GPU</small> prices. Once the crypto bubble burst, <small>GPU</small> costs fell back to earth.</p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="embed_index.html"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">Another boom began last year. As Ethereum’s price rose from $107 in March 2020 to $4,400 last month, the value of mining hardware once again followed suit. In six months, the six <small>GPU</small>s’ listed prices climbed by 150%. Those of <small>CPU</small>s barely budged.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>GPU</small> shortage has hurt data scientists and computer-aided-design users as well as gamers. Some relief may be on the way. Ethereum’s price is now 40% below its record high. <small>GPU</small> prices have yet to fall, but if history is any guide, they probably will soon. Moreover, Nvidia has tried to cripple its <small>GPU</small>s’ mining power, while promising to sell new cards targeted at miners. It is also cutting back on its output of older products to focus on newer ones.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">However, without greater production, customising chips will not end the shortage. Nvidia’s <small>RTX</small> 3080 Ti, one of its first cards with reduced mining power, is listed on Amazon at double its suggested price.</p><p class="article__body-text">Meanwhile, Ethereum’s overseers said in May that they will rejig its blockchain to require less computation, and thus less electricity. If implemented, this might lower <small>GPU</small> prices. However, as long as other cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, rely on power-hungry protocols that reward good <small>GPU</small>s, miners will pivot to different coins—and gamers will once again cry foul.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text" data-interactive-class="g-interactive-source">Sources: Amazon; Keepa; Coindesk; <i>The Economist</i></p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline "Pay to play"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Crypto-miners%20are%20probably%20to%20blame%20for%20the%20graphics-chip%20shortage&amp;publicationDate=2021-06-19&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fgit0ga2i8gmaufhm6fp5un3mfil4vpfe&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body><script>
