Mr Floyd’s death sparked months of Black Lives Matter protests across America and around the world. It ignited a campaign to reallocate funds from police departments—“defund the police”—to other public services and set off an election-year battle over “law and order” in America’s cities.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The deaths of black people at the hands of police also rocked communities in Kenosha, Wisconsin; Louisville, Kentucky; Atlanta, Georgia; and other places in 2020. According to data collected by Mapping Police Violence, a website, 1,127 people were killed by the police last year. Officers were three times more likely to kill black Americans than white ones. Tensions on the streets last summer—with the division exploited by a divisive President Donald Trump—were more heightened than they had been for years. The scenes were reminiscent of 2014 after Michael Brown, another unarmed black man, was shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.</p><p class="article__body-text">Over the past year, during which Joe Biden replaced Mr Trump in the White House, Americans think race relations have improved only marginally. According to survey data from YouGov, collected on behalf of <em>The Economist</em>, the share of Americans who believe that race relations in America are “generally bad” fell by roughly seven percentage points, from 72% in May 2020 (in the immediate aftermath of Mr Floyd's death) to 65% in April.</p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="NaN" src="latest-updates_index.html"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">Opinions on the state of relations between the police and non-whites are equally downcast. Roughly 59% of adults say they are “bad”, nearly equal to the 62% who said the same a year ago. YouGov also asked whether they thought relations had improved since Mr Floyd’s murder. Just one in ten of the adults surveyed on May 15th thought so; nearly two-fifths felt they have worsened; and half said they were unchanged. Although the police officer who killed George Floyd, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder last month, it is clear that the majority of Americans are still gloomy about the country's racial unity.</p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="embed_index.html"></iframe></p></div></body><script>
