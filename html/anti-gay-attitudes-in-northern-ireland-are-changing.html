No bill has yet been drafted—but the vote was consequential, all the same. Its most immediate effect was to trigger turmoil in the Democratic Unionist Party (<small>DUP</small>), which over the past two decades has supplanted the <small>UUP</small> as the main voice of citizens, mostly Protestant, who favour keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.</p><p class="article__body-text">Arlene Foster, then the <small>DUP</small>’s leader and Northern Ireland’s first minister, abstained; few party members followed her lead, instead voting against a ban. Within days her political career was over and the <small>DUP</small> was embroiled in leadership changes. Only in hindsight is the catalysing role of the conversion-therapy vote clear.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Faced with the prospect of Sinn Fein, the voice of militant Irish nationalism, topping next year’s elections and taking the post of first minister, you might think that pro-Union groups would make common cause. Instead they remain scratchily divided over matters of culture, identity—and sexuality. A poll in November suggested 18% would plump for the <small>DUP</small>, against 14% for the <small>UUP</small> and 11% for the ultra-conservative Traditional Unionist Voice. (Sinn Fein would get 24%.)</p><p class="article__body-text">Despite being taunted as a “queer-lover” at public meetings, Mr Beattie has stuck to his guns. In October the <small>UUP</small> released a video with few words but telling images: a girl playing Gaelic sports, people of different races and a same-sex couple. He is also liberal on abortion; on December 14th he helped vote down a <small>DUP</small> bid to restrict late terminations. Such shifting attitudes on social issues have prompted some politicians to join the <small>UUP</small> and others to leave. Harold McKee, a standard-bearer of unionism in the Mourne Mountains, quit on October 30th, lamenting that gay marriage was counter to the “infallible word of God”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Beattie says his live-and-let-live convictions are born of three decades of military service in Africa, the Balkans and Iraq, from which he learned that “people of all kinds have a need to be respected”. And gay rights are not entirely a new concern for the <small>UUP</small>. In 1981 Jeffrey Dudgeon fought and won a battle in European courts to get Northern Ireland to follow Great Britain—belatedly—in decriminalising gay sex. In 2014 he was elected a <small>UUP</small> councillor.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>UUP</small>’s modernising tone aims to capitalise on a striking feature of Northern Irish politics, says Jon Tonge of Liverpool University. Plenty of people, especially the young and women, support the Union with Britain but dislike pro-Union politics’ theocratic bent—to the point where many abstain from voting. At least in theory, the <small>DUP</small>’s social conservatism creates political space for an alternative line. Founded by Ian Paisley, a preacher who vowed to “Save Ulster from Sodomy”, it opposed same-sex marriage until the change was, in effect, imposed by London in January 2020.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In June Paula Bradley, the <small>DUP</small>’s deputy leader, formally apologised for its “atrocious” record on gay rights. But some of its most promising figures have been ostracised when they have tried to persuade colleagues to become less socially conservative. One was Guy Spence, who became deputy mayor of Belfast in 2015, aged 23. Last year he abruptly quit the <small>DUP</small> and the political arena. One point of friction, he says, was his belief that the party should move in a progressive direction, for example by supporting Gay Pride events.</p><p class="article__body-text">Anton Thompson-McCormick, a gay writer who lives in England but had an Ulster Protestant upbringing, spies a streak of pragmatism in the <small>DUP</small>’s natural voters that he thinks will eventually bring them around. When same-sex marriage was imposed by London, he says, this raised hackles among people in the province who take pride in being “thran”, a local word for stubborn. Ultimately, he believes, they will realise that “thranness and queerness can live together”. Until then Mr Beattie will continue to ruffle feathers—and Sinn Fein, which is staunchly pro-gay rights, will rejoice over its adversaries’ confusion. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Saving Ulster"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Anti-gay%20attitudes%20in%20Northern%20Ireland%20are%20changing&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F80kdbbhpj7mma7u5tqmsp6j9qtucrdd5&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
