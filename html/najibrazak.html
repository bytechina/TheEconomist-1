I would like to refer you to your write up dated 19th March 2022, titled “The resurrection of Najib Razak”. I would like to clarify a few assumptions that were mentioned in the article.</p><p class="article__body-text">You said, “It is a dizzying reversal of fortunes. On Mr Najib’s watch <small>umno’</small>s alliance was voted out of government in 2018 for the first time since Malaysia won independence more than 60 years before. That was in large part because Mr Najib was embroiled in a corruption scandal of epic proportions. Some $700m appeared in his bank account shortly after $4.5bn had been looted from 1<small>mdb</small>, a state investment fund.”</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">While approximately $700m did go into my bank account, a similar amount was also ultimately wired back to the sender of the money. </p><p class="article__body-text">Why did this happen and why did I return the money back to the sender? I have always maintained that at all material times the money coming in to my account was political donations provided by the Saudi Royal Family as the late King Abdullah was keen to see the Barisan Nasional government under my leadership continue as both governments enjoyed a good relationship. Furthermore, in knowing of the amount that would be transferred from the Saudi government, I sought the advice of the Central Bank governor, with intent of transparency, on the means and the appropriate method to receive the money. It was our regulator, and governor herself that advised me to open the account under my name.</p><p class="article__body-text">What is almost never reported in the media is that over 650m Malaysian ringgit did in fact come from the Saudi Arabian government in several tranches. This is a matter of fact that was testified by the prosecution witnesses and investigation authorities and remains undisputed.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ultimately when the money alleged to be from 1<small>mdb</small> entered my account, I had thought the moneys were part of the Saudi Arabian donation that was promised.</p><p class="article__body-text">Now going back to why was the $700m alleged to be from 1<small>mdb</small> returned to its sender? Because after the general elections, the balance of the money left in my account no longer had any use (as the donation was to help with the elections and not for personal use) so I returned it back to the entity I presumed was owned by the Saudi Royal Family.</p><p class="article__body-text">One must also ask the question, why would I put stolen money in my own bank account? Surely one would not have been that reckless if I had known the money was illegal to begin with. If the money trail of the 1<small>mdb</small> funds are correct, money had left Malaysia, made a circuit around the world before entering my account. Why bring it back to Malaysian shores where my name as Prime Minister is instantly recognizable.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Bear in mind that I was not only Prime Minister but also Minister of Finance; I controlled various agencies such as customs. If I truly knew and wanted to bring in illegal funds it could have been withdrawn in cash overseas and brought in quietly without notice.</p><p class="article__body-text">You then said, “Mr Najib maintains the money was a gift and was intended for <small>umno</small>, rather than his personal use. Authorities in America, among others, concluded otherwise. It was difficult to ignore the extra ordinary collection of tiaras and Hermes handbags amassed by Mr Najib’s wife, to say nothing of his own many flashy sports cars. In 2020, in the first of five trials, he was convicted of several charges of abuse of power and money laundering and sentenced to 12 years in prison. A judge who dismissed Mr Najib’s appeal in December called him a “national embarrassment”.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The interesting thing about this issue is that all the money that entered into the accounts are recorded on the bank statement, even more interesting are the expenditures that can be traced because they were issued by cheque and credit card. Based on this, 99.8% of the expenditures can be traced to political and charitable expenditures with the remaining 0.2% that are seemingly personal expenditures are also debatable (ie, medical treatment that I would have been entitled to get from the government in any case).</p><p class="article__body-text">On the topic of the luxury items, notwithstanding the infamous raids at my residence where boxes and boxes of items were paraded before the press, to date none of the government’s seizure applications to court have been successful because there is no link between the items seized and 1<small>mdb</small> funds. This is also because all the expenditures were recorded through the bank statements. As proven in court, with the matter settled, the government failed in its attempt to forfeit luxury items seized and the Kuala Lumpur High Court recently dismissed the suit. They had failed to prove that the goods were bought using funds from 1<small>mdb</small> as initially accused.</p><p class="article__body-text">Unlike the <small>uk </small>and <small>usa</small>, Malaysia does not have a law against public officers receiving gifts and as Prime Minister it was not uncommon for various dignitaries to gift luxurious items, as this was also practiced by former Prime Ministers. While in hindsight such practice does paint a skewed perception and perhaps it's time to legislate against this, at all material times no crime had occurred. To add, I do not have a hobby for flashy sports cars as the Malaysian public know that I do not own any.</p><p class="article__body-text">Dato Sri Najib Razak<br/>Sixth prime minister of Malaysia</p></div></body></html>
