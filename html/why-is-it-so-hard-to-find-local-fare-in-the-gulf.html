Local fare has long been limited to home kitchens, while restaurants offer grub from everywhere else. One restaurateur estimates that of the 5,000 or so eateries in Dubai, fewer than 1% serve Emirati food. A glance at a food-delivery app seems to confirm this: there are more options for Hawaiian food. It is one of the few places where visitors might spend a week and never eat a local dish.</p><p class="article__body-text">In part that is because the Gulf’s cuisine was long defined by scarcity. Less than 2% of land in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman is arable. Much of that was given over to date palms which, along with meat, yogurt and grains, formed the basis of a simple local diet. The national dish in most Gulf countries, known as <em>kabsa </em>or <em>machboos</em>, is a bed of (imported) rice topped with cuts of meat. And many dishes are time-consuming to prepare. One traditional style of cooking involves burying seasoned meat underground for hours, which is fine for family feasts but tricky for fast food.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The Gulf’s cuisine was also shaped by commerce, which can make it hard to say what exactly qualifies as “local”. Towns on the Gulf littoral traded extensively with Asian countries, and those links show up on the dinner table. <em>Machboos </em>has its roots in <em>biryani</em>, from the Indian subcontinent. The informal national drink of the Gulf, known locally as <em>karak</em>, is a cup of masala chai. For visitors curious about the local fare, Dubai’s tourism authority suggests a small chain of restaurants that serves up <em>dal </em>(an Indian dish) and <em>ash-e jow</em> (an Iranian soup).</p><p class="article__body-text">The oil boom brought millions of migrants, along with their cuisines. The most celebrated kebab joint in Dubai was founded by Iranian émigrés. America has left its mark, too. Big chains like McDonald’s are ubiquitous, along with more obscure brands (Famous Dave’s, a barbecue chain, had to tweak its logo for the Emirati market, since the original features a decidedly non-<em>halal </em>pig).</p><p class="article__body-text">In recent years both chefs and governments have made a push to revive the local fare. Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, has asked hotels to offer local options. Breakfast buffets now often feature <em>balaleet</em>, a plate of sweetened vermicelli topped with eggs, or <em>chebab</em>, pancakes topped with cream and date molasses.</p><p class="article__body-text">Younger chefs from Gulf countries have culled recipes from the experts (their grandmothers) and experimented with modern twists on local dishes. Camel-meat sliders topped with date jam would have caused befuddlement a few generations ago, but they seem a fitting match for the Gulf’s modern melting pot.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "Kitchen inconsequential"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Why%20is%20it%20so%20hard%20to%20find%20local%20fare%20in%20the%20Gulf%3F&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-01&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F6hnno8gbmm0ird0u4ipquijq1of67v96&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
