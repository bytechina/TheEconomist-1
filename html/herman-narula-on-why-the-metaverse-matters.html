shorthand for a series of interconnected virtual worlds. The metaverse is to these digital environments what the internet is to websites. Initially it will appear as something more elaborate than a video game but less than the physical world. Yet its sophistication will rapidly grow. The metaverse will contain environments where we will earn real money, forge deep relationships and have experiences that enrich our lives. This will have a profound effect on how societies function and on how the world’s economies and democracies work. </p><p class="article__body-text">I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the metaverse because I work on some of the foundational technology it needs in order to exist. My company, Improbable, creates the technical plumbing for the metaverse, enabling thousands of users to interact at the same time. The software powers virtual environments used in entertainment but also for helping governments and businesses plan, train staff and simulate the real world. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">You are right to be suspicious of my enthusiasm and that of the ambassadors from big tech. It’s legitimate to wonder whether the technologists are once again espousing some shiny new thing to make them even wealthier and to tighten their control over people’s lives. Promoters of the metaverse might seem religious in their convictions. Cynics may well argue that Meta is meant to distract attention from Facebook’s problems over antitrust, misinformation, attention-maximising algorithms and slowing growth. </p><p class="article__body-text">Do not, however, prejudge the metaverse by the suspect motives of those who might promote it. After all, the idea of a metaverse is in some ways older than most people imagine. </p><p class="article__body-text">Consider Gobekli Tepe, an ancient temple site in southern Turkey. Jutting out of the sands of Anatolia, its megaliths are around 11,000 years old. That may make it older than the development of farming and the rise of cities. Its creators may as well have lived on another planet; it was a time when woolly mammoths roamed the Earth. Yet these engineers and builders believed in a universe of ideas beyond their own. The effort required to build Gobekli Tepe reflects the importance of these other worlds, in some cases religious ones, in their lives. </p><p class="article__body-text">Throughout human history we have been influenced by worlds that we imagine beyond this one. We are inspired by characters that we invent; we find value in ideas that live outside the reality around us. You need merely visit great architectural sites, listen to exquisite music or read epic literature across millennia to see how humans invent new realms to help us live in this one. Ask your child how real Hogwarts feels to get a sense of our ability to invest in other dimensions. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Sometimes this is only escapism or frivolous play. But cognitive science sees the seriousness of it. Research reveals what we’ve long suspected: envisioning other worlds, creating new environments, solving puzzles and the satisfaction we derive from it are important for psychological fulfilment, and their absence undermines mental health. Self-determination theory, an area of social psychology, posits that people have basically three intrinsic motivations: competence (the desire to acquire skills and solve problems), autonomy (the wish to express identity and make meaningful choices) and relatedness (the meaning derived from relationships and social standing). </p><p class="article__body-text">Some people may seem obsessed with greed and avarice, but our intrinsic motivations are deeper than that. They are why people play games. It is why we work beyond the need for survival. And it is why individuals find fulfilment in everything from sport to singing. </p><p class="article__body-text">Research has shown that virtual experiences are not just virtual when it comes to their impact on the mind. They are simply treated as experiences. When you meet an ally who has saved you from an opponent in a massive, multiplayer online game, and you start talking and strike up a meaningful interaction, it isn’t a “virtual friendship”—it’s a friendship. There’s nothing “virtual” about the income from trading virtual goods. E-sports athletes are, in fact, athletes—they are engaged in acts of dexterity and focus as impressive as anyone playing golf or billiards. </p><p class="article__body-text">In the metaverse, people are not merely reading about or watching an imaginary world; they are interacting in it. It is not a fictional place but a new domain with real social, economic and political opportunities. This has the potential to broaden our intellectual diet of experiences far beyond what is possible in the physical world. </p><p class="article__body-text">I believe this is the next stage in human culture. If you are one of the world’s 2.5bn video-game players, you will have tasted the beginnings of what is possible. However, today’s games are still in their infancy. They are rigid simulations with little freedom, few consequences and are unable to scale the number of participants. This limits how fulfilling the experiences can be. As virtual worlds become more complex, they will spawn their own money, jobs, economies, artistic output, politics, social interactions and roles. </p><p class="article__body-text">Shockingly absent from discussions about the metaverse is the potential for it to improve the offline world. Many of today’s jobs do not fulfil people’s psychological needs for lives of satisfaction and meaning. They ultimately lead to a worrying psychological poverty, even if wages and social safety-nets improve. John Rawls, an American political philosopher, argued that a just society provides people with a sense of purpose, not merely survival. The metaverse may help deliver this. </p><p class="article__body-text">Importantly, the metaverse may allow the developing world to participate in new forms of economic opportunities, without the political complexity of immigration or discriminatory hiring. We already see this in gamers in the Philippines earning income from “Axie Infinity”, a cryptocurrency game. Wherever there is a mobile phone, one can imagine an employment opportunity with few prerequisites.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In terms of the environment, spending on virtual clothes, goods and experiences may mean less carbon emissions from fast fashion, transport and travel. The fashion industry is one of the most environmentally destructive, in energy use and carbon output from manufacturing and transport. Consumption of digital goods brings real satisfaction—and counts for billions of dollars in sales. Even Gucci sells virtual clothing. Imagine if a share of consumer culture is expressed digitally rather than tangibly. Environmentalists have long tried to get people to consume less, to little effect. Shifting purchases into the metaverse may be better for the planet. And though data centres rely on energy, it’s nothing compared to physical products. </p><p class="article__body-text">Despite the grounds for optimism, the metaverse needs to be approached with caution too. Proponents of the early web underestimated the incentives that propelled a handful of companies to act as overlords of our data and experiences, which regulators are now noticing. If this were to happen with the metaverse, it would be catastrophic. Allowing one or a handful of companies to control our virtual lives is certain to end in disaster. </p><p class="article__body-text">To prevent a concentration of power, the metaverse can build on blockchain technology. This would let organisations share information securely without needing to trust each other—and avoid a central gatekeeper. Though flawed in its environmental impact and scalability, the systems are rapidly improving. Governments, companies and individuals could have meaningful equity, and the technology could give a right to vote on how the systems evolve. </p><p class="article__body-text">Governments could require that platforms of significant scale use these sort of decentralised infrastructure to avoid market dominance. However, even without government edicts, the hive of creative firms may out-innovate big centralised ones. We already see this with the pace of development in decentralised finance on the ethereum blockchain. A decentralised metaverse makes the value of businesses built on top of it far more interesting to investors—and users. </p><p class="article__body-text">To be sure, there are obstacles. The metaverse will need governance. Toxic behaviour has to be policed and incentives will need to change from an attention economy that values outrage to something less extreme. Perhaps online games, which boast a variety of income streams (from subscriptions and add-on purchases to rewarding usage) can be a model. The economic incentives of virtual worlds can be made align with positive outcomes for users. </p><p class="article__body-text">The metaverse has the potential to bring fulfilment, economic opportunity and equity to people. Provided a handful of companies are prevented from dominating it, the virtual world may overcome the shortcomings of the physical one—a hope born of the recognition that digital environments are actually real places. </p><p class="article__body-text">______________ </p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Herman Narula is the chief executive of Improbable, a company that develops software and infrastructure that power virtual worlds.</i></p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Herman%20Narula%20on%20why%20the%20metaverse%20matters&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-02&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F49cs30vbm1k9aupe3uqthu4r7n2bsrm9&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
