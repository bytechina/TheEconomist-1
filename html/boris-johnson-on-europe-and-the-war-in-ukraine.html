The declarations come as both Nordic states move swiftly towards <small>NATO</small> membership, an aftershock of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. On the return flight to London, Mr Johnson <a href="./britains-security-deals-with-finland-and-sweden-shine-a-light-on-boris-johnson.html">spoke to The Economist</a> about his government’s response to the war. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Boris Johnson: </b>It was an amazing place, Harpsund [the Swedish prime minister’s residence]. Look, I think it’s been an important day because what we have done has cemented something that should really be implicit, which is that the <small>UK</small> and Sweden, the <small>UK</small> and Finland, are close friends and partners, and in the event of an attack on either of them, it’s almost unimaginable the <small>UK</small> wouldn’t come to their assistance in one way or another. But we’ve never said it before. We’ve never formalised it before, in a solemn declaration as we have today.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">I think the fact that two traditionally proud, neutral countries, are moving as they so clearly are in the direction of a much clearer alignment is a sign of how fatally badly Vladimir Putin has miscalculated about Ukraine. This is not something, not an outcome that we wanted last year, it’s not something that we’ve been campaigning for, we always understood the logic of the Swedish and the Finnish position, but frankly we see the logic of the change in their position today. Because there was every reason to think that a common-sensical Kremlin would not launch an attack on an innocent, democratic country.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>The Economist: </b>Give me a sense of your discussion in the rooms with the prime minister and the president of what this means in terms of British commitments going forward.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>What you have to understand, and I’m sure you know this very well, the <small>UK</small> already has a long history, particularly over recent years, of military and security co-operation with both those partners, particularly in the context of the Joint Expeditionary Force, which has been a really important innovation. The <small>UK</small> leads it, but with the Nordics, the Balts, the Dutch, we have a great partnership. It’s a great group and we do a lot of things together. So building on the two solemn declarations, we want to be more in the areas that I mentioned in the press conferences and that is what we discussed in the bilats. It’s intelligence sharing, it’s defence-procurement co-operation, it’s joint exercises, working together on cyber and so on.</p><p class="article__body-text">There is a very big shared agenda, but there is no doubt that it has been given a new urgency by what’s happening in Ukraine. I meant what I said in the press conference. The invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin was a massive punctuation point in post-war history. It’s the end of the easy assumptions of the post-cold-war period. We are now in a new era.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">And the decisions that these friends and allies of Britain are taking—they are their decisions. I don’t want to anticipate what they may do, even by your deadline. We have to respect what they are going to do. But if the direction of travel is confirmed then that would be very, very important. And it would be a complete repudiation of Putin’s assumptions. He thought he could somehow push <small>NATO</small> back by invading Ukraine and trying to determine the future of that country. What he has shown is <small>NATO</small>’s open-door policy remains absolutely unchanged. Not only unchanged, but that two more countries are now going through <small>NATO</small>’s open door.</p><p class="article__body-text">As for the long-term future of Ukraine itself, ask a simple question. Is Ukraine now more likely or less likely to be given protections by Western countries? The answer is more likely.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Do you have an idea what those protections may be?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ:</b> Yes, I do. The <small>UK</small> has been working on this for weeks now with our friends. We believe we will get to a situation, and this is what we’ve been talking to the others in the Quad, the Quint, the Italians. What we want is a doctrine of deterrence by denial. So that even without invoking the question of <small>NATO</small> membership, Ukraine is being given <small>NATO</small>-compatible weaponry, training and intelligence sharing of such quantity and quality that no-one will ever invade Ukraine again. That is a massive... That is not something you would have expected [before Russia’s invasion].</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> The foreign minister of Ukraine [Dmytro Kuleba] was talking about how their aspirations[…] how their idea of victory has changed. They are talking now about the full liberation of their country. Is that something that the <small>UK</small> would support, and if so what would they need to do that?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>The first thing to say is we support the Ukrainians. It’s not for us to judge what they may deem to be an acceptable outcome for them. I’ve heard Volodymyr [Zelensky] at different times give slightly different accounts of what might work. Clearly the future of Crimea is an interesting question. But, you know, let’s face it, in 2014 Putin seized sovereign Ukrainian territory. So what Mr Kuleba is saying is entirely logical.</p><p class="article__body-text">Now how do you get there? I think you have to recognise it will take further support from Ukraine’s partners, and that Ukrainians are doing this for themselves. And what they have shown is by their heroic resistance and their ability to counter-attack, they can change the odds on the ground. Look, I don’t think before this thing began, I don’t think there were many people who knew what would happen.<!-- --> There weren’t many people who would have been able to make proper evaluation of the willingness to fight of the Ukrainians. I always thought they would because I’d been there a few times and talked to some of the vets from Donbas. So when the invasion started to loom I thought: “Putin must be crazy. This is going to be a nightmare.” But so it has proved.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Are some of the <small>UK</small>’s allies in a different space? You’ve warned them in the G7 not to do a bad peace. [Is Britain] an outlier in this?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>No I don’t think so. I think that everybody’s really gone on the same intellectual journey. Everyone’s begun by thinking, “It’s a nightmare, it’s a disaster, there must be a way out, there must be an off-ramp, there must be a face-saving formula, there must be a negotiated outcome.” And everybody’s trying to work out what that could be, because we all want peace.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">But the difficulty is you can’t see how that can be done. There’s several things. Number one, Putin avowedly doesn’t want it, and just keeps saying… When he is contacted about what he wants, he just sort of says he wants to, you know, take Kyiv. So Putin’s not in that space.</p><p class="article__body-text">The second thing is, the Ukrainians themselves are not in that space. Because for understandable reasons, they see, it’s hard to see how they can negotiate sensibly with someone who is in the process of trying to devour their country. And I have to say I agree with them. So everyone is then forced into the same logical position, which is the only answer is to keep going until Putin is back to the status quo ante of February 24th—at least. For those who say, I saw a comment the other day that it’s important that Putin should not be humiliated…</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> That was President Macron?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>I think it’s also worth considering that Putin at the present time has very considerable levels of popular support for what he is doing. He has a great deal of political space to accept and to explain away an outcome that frankly we all need to see.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Would the humiliation of [President Putin] be perhaps a good thing?<br/><br/><b>BJ:</b> No, what I’m saying is that it is one of the paradoxical advantages of the situation that the strength of Putin’s popular support gives him the opportunity, actually, to be completely flexible. And to say for instance that certain objectives have been achieved, “denazifaction”, whatever, and that’s why the operation is over.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Can you see a way out of this terrible blockade of grain at Ukrainian ports?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>We are looking at that. […] We are looking at the grain blockade and what we can do to help.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>Can I ask about your idea of Britain within Europe? We’ve left the <small>EU</small>. The constellation has changed. Britain is clearly very active in <small>NATO</small> and bilaterally. You chose not have a security treaty with the <small>EU</small> during the Brexit negotiations. How does that look in the light of Ukraine? Is that validated?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ: </b>I think most fair-minded observers would say that after some sort of initial anxieties and hesitations, an independent <small>UK</small> foreign policy has really been important. I think that our ability to take decisions at speed, to be out in front, to campaign for outcomes that we want, that we are right, has been very valuable. That doesn’t mean that at the same time we haven’t been working very, very closely with our European friends—we have. We have. But, I think it has given—you can feel it, you can sense the way that people look to and respond to the <small>UK</small>, whether it’s in the Nordics, the Baltics, or the Balkans, or Ukraine.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE: </b>This idea of being first to walk around Kyiv, the first to give a speech at the Rada [Ukraine’s parliament], that’s an important part of..?</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>BJ:</b> Yes. I think we are able to give a lead in a different way. But I wouldn’t want to stress that to the exclusion of the incredibly valuable co-operation that we do with others. Other countries have also done their own remarkable things. What Olaf Scholz did on the defence budget in Germany was absolutely astonishing. What Sweden and Finland are doing is astonishing. Across the board we see countries rising to the challenge and we are pleased to be a part of that.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>TE:</b> Thank you, prime minister.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">Ukraine crisis</a></i></p></div></body></html>
