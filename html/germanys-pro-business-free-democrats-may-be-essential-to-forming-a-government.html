Polling suggests it will be hard to form a coalition without the <small>FDP</small>. The 42-year-old Mr Lindner will relish the chance to cap his rapid political ascent with a job inside Germany’s next government—ideally as finance minister. His enemies would see that as their worst nightmare.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/germanys-pro-business-free-democrats-may-be-essential-to-forming-a-government.mp3" title="Germany’s pro-business Free Democrats may be essential to forming a government"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>FDP</small> advocates tax cuts, slashing red tape, pension reform and limits to European fiscal integration. More recently it has urged a faster easing of lockdown rules. The party has doubled its support in the past year, thanks in part to the collapse of the conservative <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small>. A snappy dresser and charismatic performer who regularly tops “Germany’s hottest politician” lists, Mr Lindner dominates his party to the exclusion of its other talents. At a recent campaign event in Berlin he was swarmed by admirers after delivering a fiery speech in which he sniped viciously at the Greens’ plans for debt-funded investment.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">For decades the <small>FDP</small> was the kingmaker of German politics, propping up coalitions led by the <small>CDU</small>/<small>CSU</small> or the <small>SPD</small>. But the next government will probably need three parties to make up the numbers. That could mean a choice between a right-leaning “Jamaica” coalition, with Armin Laschet as chancellor, or an <small>SPD</small>-run “traffic-light” grouping, led by Olaf Scholz. Both would include the <small>FDP</small> and the Greens as junior partners. In 2017 Mr Lindner aborted Angela Merkel’s attempts to form a Jamaica coalition, declaring it better not to govern at all than to govern badly. “The <small>FDP</small> didn’t give us a millimetre,” says Lisa Paus, a Green <small>MP</small> involved in the talks.</p><p class="article__body-text">This year Mr Lindner will hope to give Jamaica another try. He gets on well with Mr Laschet, with whom he built a <small>CDU</small>-<small>FDP</small> coalition in North Rhine-Westphalia in 2017. But as the <small>SPD</small>’s prospects have grown, Mr Lindner has opened the door to Mr Scholz by quietly softening his stance on fiscal issues. His price for making possible a traffic-light government would be the finance ministry, a perch from which he would seek to rein in the spending plans of the <small>SPD</small> and Greens (and France’s aspirations to deepen euro-zone integration). Many Greens and Social Democrats detest Mr Lindner’s brand of politics, and the feelings are mutual. From this witches’ brew of resentment and mistrust, a government may somehow emerge.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "A dash of yellow"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Germany%E2%80%99s%20pro-business%20Free%20Democrats%20may%20be%20essential%20to%20forming%20a%20government&amp;publicationDate=2021-09-23&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fn3qpru7i66obnj17oa45suhu9s5e8rn8&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
