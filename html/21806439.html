Through the generosity of the Wampanoag Native Americans, about half the English religious separatists who arrived in Massachusetts the previous year had overcome scarcity and disease and lived to see their first successful corn harvest. As Americans prepared for their first Thanksgiving of the covid-vaccine era, disease was once again on their minds.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21806439.mp3" title="Thanksgiving is bound to cause a spike in America’s covid infections"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Surges of coronavirus infections in America tend to <a href="https://econ.st/3oI1C4u">follow waves in Europe</a>. Several European countries have been grappling with an <a href="./a-surge-of-deadly-covid-cases-in-europe-is-met-by-popular-fury-over-lockdowns.html">alarming new surge</a>. Sure enough, cases are now climbing in America too. On November 22nd it recorded 162,000 cases, the most in two months.</p><p class="article__body-text">This does not bode well for Thanksgiving. Some 53m people were expected to travel for the holiday, up by 13% from 2020—close to pre-pandemic levels. Air travel was forecast to rise by 80% compared with last year. A covid spike is all but certain.</p><p class="article__body-text">Although jabs are available for all Americans who want them, many have headed into the holiday <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/09/06/america-has-remained-unusually-vaccine-sceptical">unprotected</a>. Only 59% of Americans are fully vaccinated, compared with 68% of Britons and 76% of Canadians. <a href="./new-antiviral-drugs-mark-a-big-turning-point-in-the-covid-19-pandemic.html">New antiviral drugs</a> are expected to become available imminently, though probably not soon enough to contend with the consequences of a Thanksgiving wave.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Americans are struggling to get their hands on another effective tool: quick testing. Rapid antigen tests, though less foolproof than the more laborious <small>PCR</small> ones, can provide reliable results in minutes. People can administer their own examinations at home, with a nasal swab. Testing before mingling with friends and family would help Americans control infections. Yet these kits are still hard to come by in local pharmacies, and they are costly. The Quidel QuickVue test is priced at $23.99 on Amazon, and the On/Go one at $34.99—and even then they are not available until after the holiday. A family of four would need to spend about $100 or more.</p><p class="article__body-text">By contrast, Britain lets each person order packs of seven rapid tests free. “In other countries, we see it’s become the norm for friends and family to get tested before a party, before dinner, before celebrations,” says Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. “We need to get to that point in this country.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Some say the Food and Drug Administration (<small>FDA</small>) has unnecessarily delayed authorising rapid tests with a regulatory process that is too stringent—“letting perfect be the enemy of the good”, in the words of Dr Wen. The <small>FDA</small> has taken steps to streamline its authorisation process. But the focus should be not on the number of authorised test developers, but on the number of tests available, says an official at the administration. For that, he says, the federal government is responsible.</p><p class="article__body-text">In October the Biden administration announced its intention to quadruple the supply of home tests by the end of the year, providing greater access and potentially reducing cost through a $3bn investment. Rapid tests could be readily available in time for Christmas. By then, maybe, Americans will be able to give thanks for the freedom to gather with less fear of covid.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our <a href="./page-not-found.html">coronavirus hub</a>.
