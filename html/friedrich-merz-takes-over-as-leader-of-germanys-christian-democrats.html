There was never any love lost between Germany’s ex-chancellor and the man she forced out of a top job in the conservative Christian Democratic Union (<small>CDU</small>) in 2002. Tail between his legs, Mr Merz left the Bundestag in 2009, only to re-emerge nine years later to compete for the party leader ship Mrs Merkel had vacated. His candidacy thrilled <small>CDU</small> members seeking conservative red meat. But moderates found his arrogance off-putting. His bid flopped, as did another last year.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/friedrich-merz-takes-over-as-leader-of-germanys-christian-democrats.mp3" title="Friedrich Merz takes over as leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">But in September the winner of that second contest, Armin Laschet, led the <small>CDU</small> and its Bavarian sister party to electoral defeat. Now licking its wounds in opposition, the <small>CDU</small> has finally turned to Mr Merz, who takes over as leader this weekend. Once known as a macho tax-cutter with a taste for teasing the politically correct, Mr Merz, 66, now presents himself as a moderate. He promises to court women, gay people and young voters, and to pursue social justice.</p><p class="article__body-text">Will this convince the sceptics? <small>CDU</small> centrists seem willing to hold fire, though some <small>MP</small>s so distrust the ultras around Mr Merz that they have discussed leaving the party. Right-wingers want him to smite the woke. “We need a self-confident civic policy that…clearly positions itself against identity-politics excesses,” says Christoph Ploss, a young <small>CDU</small> <small>MP</small> who has long supported Mr Merz. The new leader’s first test comes in several state elections this year.</p><p class="article__body-text">At the next federal election in 2025 Mr Merz will hope to lead the conservatives’ bid to unseat Olaf Scholz, the chancellor. For now he will focus on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, industrial change and inflation, now at a three-decade high. Mr Merz says the European Central Bank must follow the Federal Reserve and prepare to raise rates. That the <small>ECB</small> is independent does not matter. Mr Merz wants to dispel the fog.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "A not very new broom"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Friedrich%20Merz%20takes%20over%20as%20leader%20of%20Germany%E2%80%99s%20Christian%20Democrats&amp;publicationDate=2022-01-22&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Frnveaushl5gdd1754atodtmsb1tm5ovj&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
