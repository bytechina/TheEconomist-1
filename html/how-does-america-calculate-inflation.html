Now <a href="./interest-rates-may-have-to-rise-sharply-to-fight-inflation.html">prices are rising</a> much too fast. In January they were an average of 7.5% higher than a year earlier, the fastest rate of inflation measured for 40 years, according to the consumer-price index for all urban consumers, more commonly known as the CPI. The CPI is probably the best known gauge of <a href="./whats-wrong-with-americas-consumer-price-index.html">inflation</a>. Yet calculating the average rise in prices is harder than it seems. How does the CPI work—and is it flawed? </p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1948/90/media-assets/image/20220212_WOC274.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220212_WOC274.png" srcset="../image/20220212_WOC274.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">To find the CPI, America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) regularly takes stock of around 80,000 products. This market basket, as it is known, is based on a survey of consumers’ spending that the bureau carries out every two years. It includes everything from food to cable television. Prices are gathered by visiting shops, service providers and even doctors’ surgeries around the country. Each item’s change in price is calculated. Then a weighted average is constructed depending on how important the item is to the basket. For example, Americans purchase more chicken than tofu, so the former makes up a bigger part of the CPI. The largest product categories are housing, at roughly 32% of the index, food at 14% and transport commodities (such as cars) at 8% (see chart).</p><p class="article__body-text">The CPI has its fair share of critics. The index only tracks spending by consumers in urban areas, meaning it ignores about 7% of Americans. It also suffers from a problem known as “substitution bias”. When a certain type of good gets more expensive, consumers switch to cheaper alternatives. Yet the CPI assumes substitution occurs only at a low level: people might switch between brands of chicken, but are never assumed to buy pork instead. Only when the whole basket is updated are changing consumer habits fully captured. Substitution bias causes the CPI to overstate inflation. Another bugbear is the scope of the basket. In health care, for example, the CPI measures only out-of-pocket spending, leaving out payments on behalf of consumers by their employers or the government. </p><p class="article__body-text">Some economists argue that the pandemic has been a particularly difficult time to measure inflation. Fuel prices have fluctuated wildly, crashing in 2020 and rebounding strongly in 2021. And consumer spending habits have also shifted: social distancing has caused spending on services such as restaurants to collapse and sent demand for goods soaring—a trend that has not yet fully abated. Alberto Cavallo of Harvard Business School has developed a “<a href="./whats-wrong-with-americas-consumer-price-index.html">covid-19 CPI</a>”, using credit- and debit-card data. It was higher than the official measure for most of 2020, but is now beneath it.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are plenty of official alternatives to CPI, too. The BLS publishes “chained CPI”, which—like most countries’ inflation indices—corrects for substitution bias. The Federal Reserve, America’s central bank, uses another measure of inflation, which corrects the bias and includes items that are paid for on consumers’ behalf, such as the employer’s portion of health insurance. Inflation according to these measures tends to be lower than according to the CPI, and is currently 7.1% (by the chained index) and 5.8% (on the Fed’s gauge). All these indices also provide measures of “core inflation”, which ignores energy and food prices, both of which are volatile. But even core inflation on the Fed’s preferred measure is currently a worrying 4.9%—well above the central bank’s 2% target.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./great-resignation-covid-19-america-jobs.html">Why the rich world is facing a hiring problem</a><br/><a href="./how-apples-privacy-push-cost-meta-10bn.html">How Apple’s privacy push cost Meta $10bn</a><br/><a href="./is-recep-tayyip-erdogans-monetary-policy-as-mad-as-it-seems.html">Is Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s monetary policy as mad as it seems?</a></p></div></body></html>
