Despite reports that war was imminent, few believed them. For years, Russian <small>TV</small> had reported that Vladimir Putin merely wanted to help the Russian-speakers of east Ukraine. Some in Mariupol felt valued more by the Russian government than the Ukrainian one, especially older citizens who remembered the city’s prosperity in Soviet times as a steel-making centre. Shortly before the invasion I heard someone shout “Welcome, Russia!” into the cold night sky.</p><p class="article__body-text">One of those who thought Putin might be the saviour of eastern Ukraine was an 83-year-old, whose six-month-old great-granddaughter has had to drink melted snow because Russian bombardments have cut off the city’s water supply. There is no power supply or heat, either. The baby’s family has been huddling together for weeks in dark, freezing cellars, going above ground only occasionally to cook on bonfires of discarded furniture among wrecked buildings. They saw dead bodies strewn on the streets. “It was like life in the Middle Ages, only with bombs falling,” said Liubov Belichenko, 27, the baby’s mother.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Shortly before the invasion I heard someone shout “welcome, Russia!” into the cold night sky</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Belichenko is one of those who managed to make it out through dozens of Russian checkpoints during a temporary pause in the shelling last week. Around 200,000 are still thought to be trapped. The journey was arduous: the grandmother preferred to take her chances with the bombs, even though the gold-topped church opposite her home had been hit by missiles. She was aghast at Putin’s deception, said Belichenko. </p><p class="article__body-text">Mariupol, which is about 60km from the border with Russia, has been bombed and blockaded since March 5th, with attacks intensifying over the past week. Russia needs to take Mariupol to link up its forces in southern and eastern Ukraine. Though Russian troops have succeeded in capturing other towns along the sea of Azov, Mariupol has held on – so far. Patchy phone reception meant that news has only trickled out, particularly since hardly anyone was able to leave. </p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_002.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_002.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_002.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_003.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_003.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_003.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_004.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_004.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_004.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Fanning the flames</b> Thousands of foreign volunteers are fighting for Ukraine (opening image).

The city has been under attack since February 24th</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text">In recent days, however, dazed survivors have managed to flee the city, bringing testimonies of their experiences under siege. I met a dozen of them at aid centres in the nearby city of Zaporizhzhia. Belichenko’s hair was slick with grease after two weeks without showering. Her baby wriggled contentedly, although her tiny clothes were streaked with grime and urine stains. “People in eastern Ukraine used to say ‘the Russian world will save us’,” said Belichenko, looking around at her fellow evacuees as they sipped tea next to their shivering pets. “Now everyone is shocked.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">T</span>hrough speaking to her and others, I have tried to piece together what life in Mariupol has been like. Almost every building has been hit. Missile casings litter the streets. Some corpses have been lying there for days; the smell hangs in the air as they begin to rot. People spent most of their time sitting in the dark, underground. Some admit to looting supermarkets for food to eat.</p><p class="article__body-text">It isn’t just the cold, dark and fear that makes subterranean life so grim. Mariupol’s shelters hadn’t been cleaned for years; no-one saw the need, as few believed Russia would actually attack a city with which it had such close ties. In the building where I was staying in Mariupol – after war broke out, but before bombs fell on the city centre – the shelter felt like a tomb, with stale air and surfaces thick with dust and cobwebs. Pipes leaked dirty water and cigarette butts and used needles were strewn across the floor. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“If this is Russian peace I don’t want to know what war is”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Sometimes Belichenko’s friend Ludmilla joined her in the shelter. At one point in the siege Ludmilla ran up to her apartment for supplies, and a blast shattered the windows: Belichenko had to pick fragments of shrapnel and glass out of her friend’s face. When I spoke to Ludmilla about her experiences, her face, which has the plump lips and heavy eyebrows of an Instagram influencer, was streaked with scars. </p><p class="article__body-text">This is the second time that Ludmilla and Belichenko have fled their homes. Both came to Mariupol in 2015 from further east after war broke out between Russian-backed separatists there and the Ukrainian government. Ludmilla adapted to life in Mariupol, opening a shop in the city centre, selling shoes and handbags. That shop was looted in the siege: $50,000 of stock was stolen. </p><p class="article__body-text">Ludmilla hasn’t yet thought about what she’s going to do for money; she is still reeling from what she has been through. She lived opposite the maternity hospital that was hit. “Men from my building ran out to help rescue babies and pregnant women from the ruins,” she said. “Seeing these things changes people.”</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_05.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_05.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_05.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_06.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_06.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_06.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_07.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_07.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_07.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Scorched earth</b> From top to bottom: Russian bombs have fallen all around Kharkiv, including in the city’s central square. Since the Russian invasion began, local officials say more than 600 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv and hundreds of civilians killed</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text">One of the many surreal things about the situation in Mariupol is that most people had no idea of the scale of what had happened to the city or its residents until they got out. There were teary reunions at the aid-distribution centre as people found relatives and friends and hugged them fiercely. There’s still no way to contact people who remain in the city.</p><p class="article__body-text">Many people in Mariupol have relatives in Russia. When those who got out told their Russian kin what had been happening, some refused to believe them. According to Russia only neo-Nazis have been hit in Moscow’s campaign. The people I spoke to were furious that many ordinary Russians adhere to the Kremlin line; some Ukrainians started referring to them as “bitches”.</p><p class="article__body-text">Belichenko says she wasn’t surprised that Russia had attacked Mariupol. She’d become familiar with the Russian playbook in her hometown of Donetsk. “That conflict was terrible but nothing compared to this – this war is hell,” said Belichenko. “If this is Russian peace I don’t want to know what war is.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Liz Cookman</b> is a freelance journalist in Ukraine</p><hr/><h2>Dmytro’s Kharkiv diary: “I’m trying to work out whether my bedroom is a military target” </h2><p class="article__body-text">A few days ago a shell landed right by my apartment. I didn’t know what to do. I tried to calm myself, but the car park was on fire and my window was broken. I got my cat, ran to the lobby and tried to think. I asked myself: “Where am I going to sleep tonight? I can’t sleep in the lobby. I can’t sleep in my room without the window, and the window is the least of my problems.” I wondered again if I’d made a terrible mistake deciding to stay in Kharkiv.</p><p class="article__body-text">The city is close to the border with Russia and Russian troops have been bombarding it for more than three weeks. Every night I hear the whining of Russian planes overhead, and the sound of explosions. Then I wake up to the news: 200 people evacuated, eight people dead, 20 residential buildings destroyed. Everyone in my family has left except for me and my mother. She insisted on staying – she said it was her home, and I didn’t want to leave her alone. So now, while the rest of the world is sipping coffee, I’m trying to work out whether my bedroom is a military target.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span> work in <small>IT</small>. But nowadays I spend most of my time in queues. My mother and I have been delivering supplies to old people who can’t leave their homes. Many of them live on high floors in buildings where the lifts have been disabled. Some aren’t good with technology and it’s often hard to reach them. I don’t know how they’d survive if something happened to us.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_08.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_08.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_08.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_09.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_09.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_09.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_10.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="853" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_10.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220318_Kharkiv_10.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Digging deep</b> From top to bottom: First-responders search for survivors in the rubble.

I wait for hours in line to buy it for people. The other day my mother and I waited together: we passed the time telling funny stories about the Britney Spears dances my older sisters used to do when we were all little. All that time, we could hear shells falling in the distance. It’s a strange, new reality.</p><p class="article__body-text">The shelling isn’t constant, it comes in waves. Some evenings you can almost persuade yourself into thinking you’re still in your old life. I even managed to watch a film the other night.

My father always said I lived in an alternate reality. But now I read the news constantly, mostly on Telegram. I can tell you chronologically everything that’s happened in my country since Russia invaded on February 24th. Everyone can. It’s amazing how political you can get once your life actually depends on it.</p><p class="article__body-text">Following the news is almost a full-time job now that the information war is so fraught. You get an update saying: “In case of medical emergency, here’s a reliable phone number”. Then ten minutes later they say it was a fake. Then a while later it turns out the news about it being fake was fake. </p><p class="article__body-text">I get updates from friends as well as news services. Messages like, “Hey, remember that gym you used to go to? Well it’s gone now”, or “Remember that club or a school or a cafe? Well, it’s all rubble now”. I see people like me dying every day, gathering supplies in the wrong place at the wrong time. I can’t let fear take hold of me. That’s what the Russians want. I check on everyone I care about constantly. They say that for Ukrainians “How are you” now basically means “I love you”. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“I’ve never been a patriot. I despise the idea. But now I can’t help but feel proud” </cite> </p><p class="article__body-text">I never imagined something like this could happen. Both my grandmothers are Russian, I speak Russian, and I always considered myself, well, kind of Russian. The last time there was a big confrontation with Russia, in 2014, I was worried. But I never saw missiles flying over my own head, so I didn’t pay much attention. I never expected a full-scale war with Russia. A week before this one started my dad asked me if I was concerned and I said I wasn’t. I was a blissful, ignorant fool.</p><p class="article__body-text">The father of a friend of mine lives in Moscow. She sent him a picture of a shell that landed 100 metres from her own house, and he replied: “It’s photoshopped”. I keep thinking, it’s his own daughter, how could he even think that?

I keep imagining Volodymyr Zelensky releasing a video telling us that it’s all over, it’s all fine now, that we should go and get some food. But I don’t know if that will happen. We’re tired as hell.
