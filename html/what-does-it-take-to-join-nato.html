It has grappled with many doubts about its purpose in the post-cold-war world. Yet it has expanded greatly over the decades, growing from the original 12 allies in 1949 to 30 today. The last to join was North Macedonia in 2020. Now Finland, <a href="./sweden-is-following-finlands-lead-on-joining-nato.html">and probably Sweden</a>, are <a href="./21808705.html">knocking at the door</a>. Why do countries want to join <a href="./how-russia-has-revived-nato.html">NATO</a>, and what does it take to become a member?</p><p class="article__body-text">The core attraction is <a href="./how-natos-article-5-works.html">Article 5</a> of the Washington treaty, NATO’s founding document, which sets out the mutual-defence promise: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all”. This is often taken as a guarantee to defend militarily an ally under attack; in fact, a member is committed only to “assist” and to take “such action as it deems necessary” to restore or maintain security in the North Atlantic region. This may—or may not—include armed force.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">There are few treaty rules to joining the alliance. NATO does not have an EU-style <i>acquis</i>, the vast body of legislation that new members must adopt into domestic law. Article 10 of the Washington treaty asserts that the allies may unanimously invite “any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area”. It does not define “European”, nor does it say what the members’ contribution ought to be. Membership is thus largely a matter of political discretion—above all the wishes of America, the biggest contributor to the alliance and its ultimate guarantor, which extends its nuclear deterrence across NATO.</p><p class="article__body-text">Greece and Turkey, though ruled at various times by military juntas, have been members since 1952. But with the accession of post-Franco Spain in 1982, NATO membership became more entwined with the democratisation of Europe, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Accession has thus developed into a more formal process with accepted norms. One is NATO’s “open-door” policy, whereby the alliance holds out the prospect of membership to all European countries willing and able to join. Others were the requirements set out in the Study on NATO Enlargement, a policy document from 1995. They included: a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy; the fair treatment of minorities; a commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts; the ability and willingness to make a military contribution to NATO; and civilian control over military forces. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic acceded in 1999. That year NATO launched a “membership action plan” (MAP) to help other hopefuls. For many countries NATO membership became, in effect, a step towards EU membership. NATO members have promised to spend 2% of GDP on defence, but this target is not binding, and most allies still fall short of it. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Two sets of problems have slowed NATO enlargement in recent years. One involves the tangled conflicts of the western Balkans. North Macedonia joined only after the settlement of a drawn-out dispute with Greece over its official name; Bosnia and Herzegovina, riven by internal tensions, remains in the antechamber. An even bigger difficulty has been Russia’s hostility to NATO spreading into ex-Soviet territories, particularly Georgia and Ukraine. At the Bucharest summit in 2008, divided NATO allies agreed on an awkward compromise: the two countries were not formally admitted into MAP, but were told vaguely they “will become members of NATO”. Later that year Russia waged a short war against Georgia in support of the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Similarly in Ukraine, in response to the Maidan revolution of 2014, Russia seized Crimea and fomented a separatist revolt that led to the creation of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. </p><p class="article__body-text">Russia’s <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">invasion of Ukraine</a> in February 2022, supposedly in the name of fending off NATO’s further expansion, has caused a profound change of mindset in the West. Russia is again an acute threat; defence spending is increasing in Europe, notably in Germany; allies are pouring arms into Ukraine; and after a short internal debate Finland is on the point of applying for membership, almost certainly followed by Sweden.</p><p class="article__body-text">Despite their tradition of non-alignment, both Finland and Sweden have been close to NATO, particularly since 2014—sending soldiers to Afghanistan, taking part in NATO exercises, sharing intelligence and joining meetings of the alliance. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said “we will welcome them with open arms”. Given that they are mature democracies, and highly interoperable with NATO, accession is expected to be quick. Prospective members have to send a letter of intent to NATO and, assuming it approves, hold talks on a range of political, defence, legal and technical issues. NATO would then draw up accession protocols which can be signed by ministers, or ambassadors to NATO. </p><p class="article__body-text">Even if these preliminary steps can be taken quickly, in a few weeks, membership requires ratification by all existing NATO members, which can take months. Macedonia signed the accession protocol in February 2019 but formally joined only in March 2020. NATO officials expect the process for Finland and Sweden will be much faster. “These are not normal times,” said one. </p><p class="article__body-text">Even so, at a time when Russia is accusing NATO of waging a proxy war against it, and is rattling the nuclear sabre, the accession process creates a period of vulnerability when an applicant state may face retaliation or harassment by Russia but is not formally covered by Article 5. Allies can offer interim assurances. The most explicit came from Britain, which on May 11th exchanged letters with both Sweden and Finland promising to help them if they were attacked. More reassuring still would be a similar promise from America. </p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-the-black-sea-matters-to-russia.html">Why the Black Sea matters to Russia</a><br/><a href="./what-is-finlandisation.html">What is “Finlandisation”?</a><br/><a href="./how-heavily-does-germany-rely-on-russian-energy.html">How heavily does Germany rely on Russian energy?</a></p></div></body></html>
