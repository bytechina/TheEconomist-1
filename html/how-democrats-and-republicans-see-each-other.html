It has been more than 18 months since <a href="/united-states/2022/08/17/liz-cheney-is-vanquished-by-donald-trump">Liz Cheney</a> voted to impeach Donald Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol on January 6th 2021—one of only ten Republicans in the House of Representatives to do so. Since then the congresswoman from Wyoming has been praised by political pundits, cheered by newspaper columnists and honoured with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, bestowed by the former president’s library. Such plaudits meant little on August 16th, when voters in Wyoming’s Republican primary ousted the three-term congresswoman by a 37-point margin. Ms Cheney won just 29% of the vote, compared with 66% for her Trump-backed opponent, Harriet Hageman. </p><figure class="g-fallback" data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure class="interactive-figure"><iframe height="NaN" src="20220820_WOC545_index.html"></iframe></figure><p class="article__body-text">Relations between Democrats and Republicans are growing <a href="/united-states/2022/07/06/high-noon-for-liz-cheney">more rancorous</a>, making it far harder for lawmakers like Ms Cheney to buck the party line, however <a href="/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations">justified the cause</a>. A survey of American adults conducted between June 27th and July 4th by the Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, found that 62% of Republicans have a very unfavourable view of Democrats, up from 21% in 1994. The share of Democrats with similar views of Republicans has increased from 17% to 54% during the same period. You might suppose that independent voters who are unaffiliated with a party but “lean” towards one side would hold more positive views of the other. In fact they are nearly as negative. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1447/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="336px" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1447/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/200/226/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 200w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/300/339/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 300w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/400/452/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 400w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/678/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 600w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/640/724/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 640w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/800/904/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 800w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1000/1130/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 1000w,https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1447/90/media-assets/image/20220820_WOC562.png 1280w"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Americans are increasingly willing to not only express their disapproval of members of the other party, but to assign them negative personality traits. According to Pew, large majorities of Democrats and Republicans now regard those in the opposing party as closed-minded, dishonest and immoral. Such appraisals often reflect partisan stereotypes. Republicans, who extol the virtues of hard work and personal responsibility, are more than twice as likely to say that Democrats are lazy. Democrats, meanwhile, who profess to have greater tolerance of different cultures and lifestyles, are more likely to say Republicans have closed minds. Roughly half of each group says that members of the other party are less intelligent. </p><p class="article__body-text">Some politicians think that more choice is the answer. Last month Andrew Yang, a former Democratic presidential candidate, and Christine Todd Whitman, a former Republican governor, launched a new party, Forward. Its founders say that Americans are frustrated with the two major parties because they cater to the political extremes, rather than to the centre. But this may misdiagnose the problem. Although it is true that more Americans than ever have unfavourable views of both parties, the most powerful force in American politics is not dissatisfaction with the entire system but hatred of the other side. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>For more coverage of Joe Biden’s presidency, visit our <a href="/president-joe-biden">dedicated hub</a> and follow along as we track shifts in his <a href="https://econ.st/3BCgX9s">approval rating</a>.
