Many drive to nearby grocery stores to buy bottles. But unlike her neighbours Lisa Williams does not have a car, so she uses what comes out of her tap, even though the community’s water has tested above the federal-action limit for lead since 2018. “I have to,” Ms Williams laments; the bottled water that volunteers drop off goes only so far.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/fixing-the-lead-pipe-problem-in-benton-harbor-and-across-america.mp3" title="Fixing the lead-pipe problem in Benton Harbor, and across America"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">After Benton Harbor—a city of nearly 10,000 people, over 80% of them black—made headlines for its water crisis this year, Michigan promised to replace all the town’s lead service lines within 18 months. That did not stop its residents from filing a class-action lawsuit in November alleging deliberate government indifference. The same day a judge approved a $626m settlement for people affected by a water crisis across the state in Flint, which caused a similar media frenzy after residents complained about tainted water in 2014. Getting national attention, it seems, pays off. Like Flint’s residents, Ms Williams will soon be able to trust the tap.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Many of the 22m or so people across America served by lead service lines can look forward to doing the same. Congress has earmarked $25bn for water repairs, between a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a yet-to-be-passed Build Back Better Act. Even so, that is about $20bn short of what experts say is needed to replace all lead services lines in the country.</p><p class="article__body-text">Benton Harbor exemplifies how many low-income communities have managed to obtain funding in the past: grassroots organising. The town has become America’s new “lead hotspot”, evoking comparisons with Flint and other cities that received big investments after public protests and national press coverage. In September the Benton Harbor Community Water Council petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (<small>EPA</small>) for a free source of safe drinking water. “We knew that by having that press conference when we filed that petition it would get people excited,” says Edward Pinkney, the council’s president.</p><p class="article__body-text">Things moved quickly. Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has secured more than half of the $30m needed to replace all Benton’s lead lines. And she has called on the state legislature to allocate $11.4m from the American Rescue Plan, the stimulus package passed in March.</p><p class="article__body-text">But other cash-strapped towns must vie for limited funding. Even low levels of lead in children can result in behavioural problems, lower <small>IQ</small> and anaemia. In pregnant women, it can induce premature birth and reduced fetal growth, and in adults more generally it can decrease kidney function and cause reproductive problems. The <small>EPA</small> allocates roughly $1bn a year to supporting water-infrastructure projects, including lead-pipe replacements, through grants and loans. Poorer places may struggle to repay even low-interest loans, however. A lack of robust testing means that several communities are likely to be unaware of the level of lead in their water.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Hence the importance of the money promised by the Biden administration. The bipartisan infrastructure bill sets aside $15bn for lead-pipe replacements. The $1.7trn Build Back Better bill, still stuck in the Senate, could provide nearly $10bn on top of that, for pipe replacements and mitigation tactics such as filters aimed at schools. Though not as much as originally promised, the money will go a long way towards tackling the problem.</p><p class="article__body-text">Because Benton Harbor does not need to depend on this money, it is luckier than many communities left hoping for federal funds. The town should have clean water before long. In the meantime, its residents will remain wary.</p><p class="article__body-text">Every day, Mr Pinkney drives a <small>U</small>-Haul truck through town to pass out water bottles with some of his two dozen volunteers. Long before the state ramped up its efforts, he distrusted the water supply. “It wasn’t the right colour,” he grimaces. He has not drunk from his tap for nearly a decade.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Pinkney blames the city and state governments for not doing more to fix the city’s lead problems, citing years of mismanagement and environmental racism. The pipes should have been replaced three years ago, he says, as soon as testing showed the town to be falling foul of federal standards. That’s why they had to petition, he says: “It got people moving that never would have moved before.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For exclusive insight and reading recommendations from our correspondents in America, <a href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "Message in a bottle"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Fixing%20the%20lead-pipe%20problem%20in%20Benton%20Harbor%2C%20and%20across%20America&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F13h0lsdoaj0ln2bute0v4rl0vb1qq5if&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
