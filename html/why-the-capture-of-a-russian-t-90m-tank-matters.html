Swathes of territory have been <a href="./vladimir-putins-situation-looks-ever-more-desperate.html">won back</a> and Ukraine’s army captured around a brigade’s worth of military equipment from the fleeing Russians. One of the greatest surprises uncovered was a single <small>T-90M</small> <a href="./page-not-found.html">tank</a>. It is one of at least 380 Russian tanks seized since the war began, yet it is uniquely useful. What is the <small>T-90M</small> tank, and why does it matter?</p><p class="article__body-text">Seizing a weapon can provide valuable insight into the state of an enemy’s military technology. That makes countries protective of their weapons in war. American efforts to inspect the<small> T-72</small> throughout the Cold War backfired on several occasions, until a rogue Romanian arms dealer sold one to American agents in 1987, supposedly as scrap metal. The deal was later uncovered and made public by the <small>KGB</small>. The prized <small>T-72</small> had been in service for 14 years before America finally had a chance to inspect it, by which time it had already been superseded. By contrast, the <small>T-90M</small> has been in service for just two years.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__V79Pp adComponent_incontent__Bxd2J adComponent_hidden___o_ZB advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__dO1Zm" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>T90M</small>—also known as Proryv-3, meaning “breakthrough”—is Russia’s best active tank. It is an upgrade of the earlier <small>T-90</small> model which was introduced in the early 1990s. Both models, of which the army has several hundred, are far superior to the Soviet tanks still widely used by both Russia and Ukraine. <small>T-90M</small>s were not deployed during the initial invasion. Some analysts suspected that they were being reserved for a possible war with <small>NATO</small>—until they appeared a couple of months into the war.</p><p class="article__body-text">The tank has several levels of defence. The outermost is a “stealth cape” called Nakidka, an unknown material that Russia claims can absorb both heat and radio signals. This coating theoretically cloaks the <small>T-90M</small> from <small>NATO</small>’s airborne radars, which track Russian vehicles at long range. It also hinders the use of guided <a href="./how-tanks-can-survive-against-cheap-shoulder-fired-missiles.html">anti-tank missiles</a> which rely on thermal imaging to lock onto their target. On top of that, the tank has an Afghanit active protection system, which fires projectiles to intercept attacks at short range. Any attacks that reach the <small>T90-M</small> tank must also penetrate its explosive reactive armour, used by many models of Russian tanks, which can disrupt the detonation of anti-tank missiles. Finally there is the tank’s physical armour, a closely guarded secret.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>T-90M</small> is not invulnerable: <a href="./could-ukraines-anti-tank-missiles-hamper-a-russian-invasion.html">Ukrainian forces have already destroyed one</a>. But capturing one is far more useful. Being able to disassemble and analyse a top-of-the-range Russian tank will make it easier to defeat more <small>T90-M</small>s in future. As well as its high-tech defences, the captured tank has the latest Russian offensive weaponry, including a computerised fire-control system and a gun capable of firing guided projectiles. The captured<small> T-90M</small> specimen will give military analysts a chance to assess Russia’s claims about these capabilities. And as the war in Ukraine grinds on, the intelligence bonanza will continue. The West has already gained access to a variety of Russian radar, intelligence gathering and command vehicles with their valuable secrets. Fleeing Russian soldiers ought to be more careful about what they leave behind.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text">More from <i>The Economist explains:</i><br/><a href="./do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict.html">Do Russia’s military setbacks increase the risk of nuclear conflict?</a><br/><a href="./what-are-harm-the-air-to-surface-missiles-destroying-russian-air-defence-radar.html">What are <small>HARM</small>, the air-to-surface missiles destroying Russian air-defence radar?</a><br/><a href="./why-ukraines-supply-of-anti-tank-weapons-may-tail-off.html">Why Ukraine’s supply of anti-tank weapons may tail off</a></p></div></body></html>
