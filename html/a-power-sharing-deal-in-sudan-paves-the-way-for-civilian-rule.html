For nearly 30 years Omar al-Bashir led a crooked and genocidal regime in Sudan. On August 19th, four months after being ousted in a coup, Mr Bashir sat in a cage in a Sudanese courtroom. It was the first day of his trial for corruption. When asked where he lived, Mr Bashir seemed amused by his comeuppance. “Formerly the airport district, at army headquarters, but now Kobar prison,” he said with a laugh.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/a-power-sharing-deal-in-sudan-paves-the-way-for-civilian-rule.mp3" title="A power-sharing deal in Sudan paves the way for civilian rule"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Sudan is entering a new chapter, and the trial of Mr Bashir is only part of it. A day earlier, after months of negotiations, the military junta that has run things since the coup agreed to share power with civilian leaders. A transitional government led by Abdalla Hamdok, an economist, is expected to take over on September 1st. If all goes well elections will be held in 2022. News of the deal caused the streets of the capital to erupt in celebration. But many of the democrats rejoicing were also nervous about the path ahead.</p><p class="article__body-text">That is because the generals still hold much sway. They signed the agreement only after coming under intense pressure from foreign powers. Under the deal, a new Sovereign Council responsible for defence and foreign affairs will be made up of five soldiers and six civilians. But it will be led by Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for 21 months (after which he is supposed to hand over to a civilian). The army also controls the defence and interior ministries, which have large budgets and were responsible for past abuses. The generals, who accumulated vast wealth under Mr Bashir, are already buying off opponents.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The appointment of Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti) to the council is particularly worrying. The paramilitary commander is said to be one of the richest men in Sudan, having strong-armed his way into the gold business. He is also intensely feared. His Rapid Support Forces (<small>RSF</small>) grew out of the Janjaweed, a militia responsible for genocide in Darfur. The <small>RSF</small> led a bloody crackdown on protesters in June, killing more than 100. The generals may worry that real reform will lead to accountability. It is notable that Mr Bashir is on trial only for corruption—not torture or murder, in which the armed forces and security services were complicit.</p><p class="article__body-text">Sudan is huge and disunited. Rebel leaders in Darfur, Blue Nile state and South Kordofan rejected the power-sharing agreement, arguing that it did too little to accommodate them. The generals have tried to cut separate deals with these groups. “Given the junta’s desire to divide and rule, the civilian opposition cannot afford to be seen as excluding the rebels from the transition,” says the International Crisis Group, a think-tank. But the opposition is itself divided. Some factions have rejected the agreement because of the role of former junta members and the failure to hold them accountable for past violence.</p><p class="article__body-text">The new government faces immediate challenges, not least a collapsing economy. It will try to convince America to remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terror, which would open it up to foreign investment. The <small>IMF</small> and World Bank might then help Sudan deal with a mountain of public debt. All that will take time. Meanwhile, Sudanese people are suffering from shortages of food, fuel and electricity. Anger over a spike in the price of bread sparked the first protests against Mr Bashir last year. More unrest may be unavoidable. But for now, at least, there is hope. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "The start of something new?"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20power-sharing%20deal%20in%20Sudan%20paves%20the%20way%20for%20civilian%20rule&amp;publicationDate=2019-08-22&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fvsv17e6f56s8hlmfg3b0pt9n19rkuaan&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
