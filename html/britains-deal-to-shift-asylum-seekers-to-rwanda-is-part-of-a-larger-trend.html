On April 13th Britain dampened that hope. It signed a pilot-scheme agreement with Rwanda, an African country 4,500 miles (7,200km) away, to accept asylum-seekers who arrive in Britain “illegally”. Rather than having their claims for asylum considered in Britain, they will be given a one-way ticket to Kigali, Rwanda’s capital, where their applications will be processed. Those granted asylum would be able to remain in Rwanda. People not entitled to protection will be deported only to countries where they have a right to live. </span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, and home secretary, Priti Patel, portrayed the agreement as a humanitarian measure. Ms Patel said that it would stop the “evil people smugglers” who encourage migrants to cross the English Channel in unseaworthy craft. Last year more than 28,000 people arrived that way. At least 44 disappeared, presumed drowned. Yet refugees’ advocates were quick to denounce the new policy as “inhumane” and possibly illegal. It will do nothing to stop the dangerous trafficking of migrants from France to Britain, they contend, and in the short run may even encourage it as people seek to make the trip before the scheme is properly up and running.</span></p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><span>Britain’s attempt to outsource the processing and settlement of asylum-seekers is the latest in a series of measures taken by governments to “externalise” responsibility for dealing with them. Australia pioneered the concept. In 2012 it began shipping migrants who arrived by boat to Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the south-western Pacific. </span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>In Europe externalisation initiatives multiplied after 2015, when more than 1m refugees from Syria’s war and other humanitarian catastrophes arrived to a hostile reception in many countries. In 2016 the European Union signed a deal with Turkey under which Turkey agreed to take back “irregular migrants” in exchange for aid and progress on liberalising visa rules for Turks and on Turkey’s bid to join the bloc. EU states also provide assistance to Libyan coastguards who intercept migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean. And last year Denmark signed an agreement on migration with Rwanda, but it has yet to ship any asylum-seekers there.</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>The results of such buck-passing policies are mixed. Australia’s initiative was cruel, costly and ineffective. In 2016 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said 1,200 people who had been transferred to Nauru had suffered “severe abuse, inhumane treatment, and neglect”. Australia spends about A$1bn ($740m) a year to house what is now thought to be a few hundred people. On its own the policy did not deter migrants: in its first year the number of asylum-seekers arriving by boat hit a record high.</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>The EU-Turkey deal, by contrast, did lead to a fall in the number of migrants crossing the Aegean. Turkey currently hosts more than 4m refugees, most of them from Syria. But their situation is precarious, in part because Turkey does not recognise an international legal obligation to protect refugees who come from outside Europe. Human-rights advocates claim that the Greek coastguard pushes seaborne asylum-seekers back into Turkish waters (the government in Athens denies this). As for Libya, a report published by Amnesty last year alleges that migrants who are intercepted by its coastguards can end up suffering horrific abuse in detention centres there.</span></p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><span>Britain’s deal with Rwanda is supposed to deter asylum-seekers from venturing across the channel and, if they still make the journey, provide a safer alternative to </span><span>turning back boats before they reach British shores</span><span>. After an initial screening in Britain, asylum-seekers will be deported to Rwanda, whose government has agreed to give them secure and salubrious accommodation. They will not be subject to detention. Although the UN’s refugee agency has denounced Britain’s new deal, it also co-operates with Rwanda under a scheme whereby it transfers refugees from Libya to “safety” in the east African country.</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>That does not mean that peaceful, prosperous Britain should be shipping out asylum-seekers as Libya does. Although Rwanda is a signatory of the Refugee Convention of 1951, and therefore obliged not to send asylum-seekers to places where they face persecution, it is not clear that the country will protect the rights of all who arrive from Britain, especially if they are gay. The country’s leader since 2000, Paul Kagame, is an autocrat; the British government itself offered criticisms of Rwanda's human-rights record last year. </span></p><p class="article__body-text"><span>Nor is it clear what sort of lives Iranians and Iraqis, the nationalities who sail to Britain in the greatest numbers, will be able to make for themselves in Rwanda. A large proportion of people whom Britain now proposes to deport would be recognised as genuine refugees if they were allowed to remain and have their claims heard in the country; last year the Home Office gave protection to nearly three-quarters of people who sought it. Ms Patel’s policy is certain to be challenged in court. But if she prevails, people who have reason to fear persecution in their home countries will now be warehoused in Rwanda rather than making new lives for themselves in Britain. </span></p></div></body></html>
