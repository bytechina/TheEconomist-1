In case anyone were in any doubt, Mr Putin three days later <a href="./with-his-war-going-slowly-vladimir-putin-raises-the-nuclear-stakes.html">put his nuclear forces</a> on “special combat readiness”, though he did not explain what that meant in practice. The chances of an escalating confrontation leading to the use of nuclear weapons in Europe are still <a href="./the-risk-of-escalation-past-the-nuclear-threshold.html">low</a>. Were the situation to get drastically worse, however, would Russia really drop a nuclear bomb on a NATO country? Would it use one against Ukraine?</p><p class="article__body-text">The real answers to those questions lie, of course, in Mr Putin’s mind. But Russia has a military doctrine which is supposed to guide the deployment of its nuclear forces. Today Russia is estimated to have 1,588 deployed nuclear warheads and 2,889 in reserve, similar numbers to America. Russia is also thought to have thousands of non-strategic nuclear weapons, which do much less damage than the city-destroying ones mounted on intercontinental ballistic missiles. It views them as a way of compensating for NATO’s strength in advanced conventional weapons. On March 26th Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s national security council (second only to Mr Putin) and the country’s former president, referred to the military doctrine when he laid out the situations which might prompt Russia to use those weapons. They include “an act of aggression [...] against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons”, Mr Medvedev said in an interview. The doctrine was mostly drawn up with the oversight of Mr Putin when he was head of the national security council, in 1999, and then prime minister. It does allow the first use of nuclear weapons, in certain circumstances. To understand its full significance, though, it is necessary to go back further, to the Soviet Union’s nuclear posture.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">For most of the cold war the Soviet Union and America treated nuclear weapons as the ultimate deterrent. Targeted mostly on cities, strategic nuclear weapons were so destructive that their use was also almost unimaginable. Officially the Soviet Union renounced the first use of nuclear weapons in 1982. The American and Soviet defence establishments mostly knew what each other was doing. Their shared doctrine of mutually assured destruction, which ensured that neither could win a nuclear war, rested on mutual understanding. But America’s superiority in conventional weaponry—revealed during the Gulf war in 1990—changed all this. Unable to keep pace, Russia came to rely more on its nuclear forces. It eschewed no-first-use in 1993, when its army was at a low ebb. In 2000, its revised military doctrine said a nuclear strike could be used against an opponent whose conventional forces threatened to overwhelm Russia’s conventional defences. In theory, this greater reliance on nuclear forces was just temporary, until Russia could match America’s conventional forces.</p><p class="article__body-text">In practice, however, Russia is not catching up, and its officials have begun to talk about more uses for their nuclear forces. In 2009, Mr Putin’s successor as head of the security council said Russia had the option to use limited nuclear strikes against an aggressor “using conventional weapons in an all-out, regional or even local war”. He also referred to “pre-emptive nuclear strikes”. In other words, nukes were not just the ultimate weapon, to be used in extremis. They could be tactical, used against command-and-control centres or airbases, not cities, and capable of inflicting, in the Russian parlance, “tailored damage”. In a strange reversal of the ordinary meaning of words, the military doctrine even refers to going nuclear as “de-escalation” because the destruction caused by such strikes would be (supposedly) limited. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Since then, Russia has spelled out more clearly the circumstances in which it would use nukes. The most recent version of its military doctrine (in 2010) said it could use them against an opponent with conventional forces “when the very existence of the state is under threat”. That seemed a somewhat stricter requirement than the doctrine of 2000 which allowed nuclear use “in situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation”. In 2020, the government added that it “considers nuclear weapons exclusively as a means of deterrence”. Russia’s nuclear weapons are also supposed to be used only in conflicts with other nuclear-armed states.</p><p class="article__body-text">But Russia could nevertheless use nuclear weapons against NATO and keep to the letter of its military doctrine. NATO, after all, has nuclear weapons; Russia says that Western sanctions in support Ukraine constitutes “a declaration of war” (so on this reading NATO is the aggressor); and Mr Putin has repeatedly asserted that America and the West are seeking to destroy Russia (implying that the existence of the state is under threat). Some argue that Russia might even use a nuclear device against Ukraine because, though Ukraine has no nuclear weapons, Russia has accused it (without evidence) of building a plutonium-fuelled “dirty bomb”. Russia developed its post-cold-war military doctrine of using nuclear weapons because it feared defeat in a conventional war against America. Although the prospect is unlikely, if Russia ever were to face conventional defeat in Ukraine, Mr Putin could be forced to decide whether or not to put his doctrine into practice. </p><p class="article__body-text"><i><b>Editor’s note (March 30th 2022):</b> This article was updated to include information about Russia’s non-strategic nuclear weapons.</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">Ukraine crisis</a></i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./could-vladimir-putin-be-prosecuted-by-a-nuremberg-style-tribunal.html">Could Vladimir Putin be prosecuted by a Nuremberg-style tribunal?</a><br/><a href="./what-makes-biological-weapons-so-dangerous-and-does-russia-have-them.html">What makes biological weapons so dangerous, and does Russia have them?</a><br/><a href="./why-russian-radios-ukraine-war-intercepted-heavy-metal.html">Why Russian radios in Ukraine are getting spammed with heavy metal</a></p></div></body></html>
