But after his company’s first face mask came off the production line in Austin, Texas, he faced problems of his own. A small sensor went down, halting operations, and he realised that a replacement would take five days to arrive from Taiwan. He found himself competing for American customers with Chinese companies selling masks for less than they cost to ship. Without government intervention, he warned that America would again face shortages of crucial protective equipment. “We need to make some of this locally,” he says. “We just do.”</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/in-search-of-resilience.mp3" title="In search of resilience"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Armbrust is not alone in thinking supply chains warrant government intervention. The virus came with a flurry of export restrictions on medical products and a plunge in Chinese exports that raised doubts over whether its production clusters had exposed the world to excessive risk. The private sector promises to adapt. Jacob Wallenberg of the European Round Table for Industry reports more plan Bs in place than two years ago, as well as supply-chain issues appearing on boardroom agendas. But inflation has now popped up as often as logistics, so the emphasis on just-in-case rather than just-in-time may prove fleeting.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Policymakers are unlikely to leave everything to private companies. Indeed, the Biden administration has blamed some vulnerabilities on the drive for corporate efficiency, and a goal of greater resilience now frames its trade policy. Luz María de la Mora, Mexico’s undersecretary for foreign trade, says “there’s a reassessment of how far we can go in this globalisation.” That means looking at strengthening domestic industry according to criteria beyond just the market. In Japan officials are considering how to maintain industrial bases in sensitive technologies and industries. The European Commission has adopted resilience as a “new compass for <small>EU</small> policymaking”, persuading even champions of open trade to fret about “strategic dependence”.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/727/90/sites/default/files/20211009_SRC205.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20211009_SRC205.png" srcset="../image/20211009_SRC205.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The rhetoric around greater resilience is further advanced than any concrete action. And over time, some will turn out to be little more than hype, or window-dressing for policies that were planned already. Many poor countries worry that the pandemic has exposed long-standing vulnerabilities that are hard to fix, most obviously their dependence on tourism. But in richer places the policy responses will involve a grab for three things: facts, friends and fortification.</p><p class="article__body-text">The urge to gather information has taken the form of a wave of supply-chain reviews. The Biden administration is doing one, as is the British government, which has a secretive “Project Defend” to identify supply-chain vulnerabilities. These reviews seek to dig into individual industries and identify sources of supply so concentrated that they justify intervention. Such investigations can be hard, requiring data that often do not exist. The extent of dependence will vary according to domestic production, the concentration of foreign sourcing and the availability of close substitutes. The American review found that the Food and Drug Administration did not know how many pharmaceutical ingredients were sourced from abroad, only the number of registered facilities. As important as knowing what is made and imported is knowing what could be made or procured in a pinch. Such information is even harder to find.</p><p class="article__body-text">Some results are trickling in. A review by the European Commission identified 137 of 5,000 imported products with a dominant foreign supplier. Of those, only around 34 were hard to substitute by using other suppliers, representing just 0.6% of <small>EU</small> imports by value. That sort of finding has prompted Simon Evenett of Global Trade Alert, a trade watchdog, to describe the problem of resilience as “a bit like a Russian doll—there’s less and less there.” Such exercises may understate the problem, however. The sensor Mr Armbrust needed was worth more to his operation than the $5 it cost him. And if a single-sourced input is processed in different places, a buyer may miss a key vulnerability. In June the <small>G</small>7 floated the idea of supply-chain stress tests, rather like those that are now carried out for banks.</p><p class="article__body-text">The information gathering will continue—and with it demands on private companies to share data. Policymakers appear to be coalescing around a set of products of particular concern. In a review of critical supply chains that was published in June, the Biden administration honed in on electric vehicles, active pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductors and rare earths. (In 2019 Taiwan accounted for 92% of high-end semiconductor production.) The European Commission emphasised lithium batteries for electric vehicles, active pharmaceutical ingredients, semiconductors and raw materials (including rare earths), as well as cloud and edge computing.</p></div><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The second strand of actions to foster resilience involves bolstering alliances between like-minded allies, to diversify and “friend-shore” production away from China. Some of this has an air of performance, though after four years of Donald Trump badmouthing America’s allies, some public schmoozing may be welcome. But much responds to problems that have been recognised for years, such as the heavily concentrated business of mining and processing rare earths. Possible collaborations include one between America, Australia and Japan to increase processing capacity outside China, and another between the <small>EU</small> and Canada to match investors with potential projects.</p><h2>Subsidy wars</h2><p class="article__body-text">Much of this co-ordination is only at an early stage. In June a long-running dispute over aircraft subsidies between America, Britain and the <small>EU</small> was settled by creating two new co-operative frameworks, to analyse jointly “non-market practices”—that means Chinese subsidies—“with the goal of establishing the basis for joint or parallel action in the future”. Other links are meant to manage a shift of supply chains, like the agreement in April between Japan and America to collaborate over semiconductors.</p><p class="article__body-text">The third prong of governments’ quest for greater resilience involves fortifying domestic economies. This implies sharpening defensive trade tools. In May Katherine Tai, the <small>US</small> trade representative, called for new defensive tools to deal with prospective damage to American business from foreign competition rather than responding only after the fact. Britain is also reviewing trade remedies, out of concern that in 2020 33% of goods exports were potentially in competition with companies benefiting from state subsidies, up from 7% in 2010. And the <small>EU</small> is creating defences in its single market against foreign subsidies.</p><p class="article__body-text">It also implies an inward turn. The “Buy America” laws that the Biden administration hopes to strengthen will further reduce foreign access to a massive public-procurement market. Mr Armbrust has heard that help from the government is coming; the innovation and competition bill before Congress includes a supply-chain resilience programme to reshore production of personal protective equipment and medicines. In China, where the authorities were rattled by American restrictions on exports of some technologies, the government has reportedly issued new procurement guidelines setting local content requirements of up to 100% for 315 items, including medical equipment and seismic instruments. The government’s 14th five-year plan in March included a strategy to increase self-reliance by raising spending on research by 7% a year.</p><p class="article__body-text">This fits with a general tilt towards industrial policy. In the pandemic, the fear was that foreign suppliers might protect national interests at the expense of trade flows. When British and American cash for vaccine-makers came on condition that production would go first to their populations, other countries like Australia, Canada, South Africa and South Korea that wanted to secure supplies invested in the final stage of production. In July the <small>WTO</small> valiantly published a list of vaccine inputs, to help governments assess which trade flows not to impede. Many politicians now believe that in a crisis foreign suppliers are unreliable.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The semiconductor industry is being vigorously chased by government cash, in part because of the perception that existing production sites arose from public subsidy. The Biden administration’s review noted that the Taiwanese government covers 50% of land costs and 45% of construction and facility costs for semiconductor fabrication facilities; and that South Korean subsidies cut the cost of owning a semiconductor manufacturing facility by 25-30%. A bill to support semiconductor manufacturing to the tune of $52bn is currently going through Congress. Japan is dangling financial incentives to entice <small>TSMC</small>, a Taiwanese company, to set up a facility. <small>EU</small> members are similarly eyeing a partnership with Intel.</p><p class="article__body-text">It remains to be seen how far such spending might spread. The European Commission has funnelled €6bn ($7bn) to a pan-European research and innovation project to support the battery supply chain since December 2019, but it faces sharp budget constraints. Japan has allocated up to ¥457bn ($4.2bn) in grants for companies to diversify supply chains, with little enough effect to show how expensive incentives can be.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Evenett worries that these behind-the-border measures will further distort trade. Places already comfortable with the idea of localising production may be emboldened. Trudi Hartzenberg of the Trade Law Centre, a South African think-tank, says the pandemic has bolstered the resolve to develop productive capacity in South Africa, which is linked to the government’s push to waive intellectual-property provisions in <small>WTO</small> rules. In April 2020, as part of its resilience drive, India introduced “production-linked incentives”, first for large-scale electronics manufacturing and pharmaceutical ingredients, and from November for ten other industries, including textiles, car parts and solar modules. If qualifying companies increase sales by a certain amount, they receive cash equal to 4-6% of the gain.</p><p class="article__body-text">If governments successfully foster critical industries, their alliances will go from nice to necessary. For when supply shoots up, prices crash and everyone tries to export the same subsidised products, trade tensions quickly increase. That was the lesson from Mr Armbrust’s complaints about Chinese competitors, and indeed from the fight between America and the <small>EU</small> over aircraft subsidies. And if conflict seems likely over supply-chain reshoring, it is even more inevitable from another source of strain on the trading system: the wish to fight human-rights abuses.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Full contents of this special report</strong><br/><a data-tegid="ekhqsq5j0fut1q650c8mp7bmlbodgc2b" href="./the-new-order-of-trade.html"><em>World trade: The new order of trade</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="m5fqo2geu0lgbhr0s112q2sjhhji696j" href="./a-fraying-system.html"><em>Trade law: A fraying system</em></a><br/><em>Precautionism: In search of resilience</em>* <br/><a data-tegid="psj4nouggm7ift8gq3su2bnootkacji5" href="./the-urge-to-protect.html"><em>Labour rights: The urge to protect</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="p2ocmcuccj51co6r46nrm2nfjlv7irf1" href="./making-trade-greener.html"><em>The environment: Making trade greener</em></a><br/><a data-tegid="rve95dtrmj7lvmiacpp7d64c7ip0rqds" href="./a-changed-world.html"><em>The new rules: A changed world</em></a></p><div class="ds-chapter-list"><h2 class="ds-section-headline"><a class="ds-section-headline-link" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-10-09">World trade</a> <span class="ds-section-subheadline">the new order</span></h2><ul><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/the-new-order-of-trade"><span>The new order of trade</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/a-fraying-system"><span>A fraying system</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor ds-link-with-arrow--selected" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/in-search-of-resilience"><span>In search of resilience</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/the-urge-to-protect"><span>The urge to protect</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/making-trade-greener"><span>Making trade greener</span></a></li><li class="ds-chapter-list__item"><a class="ds-link-with-arrow ds-link-with-arrow--minor" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/10/06/a-changed-world"><span>A changed world</span></a></li></ul></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline "In search of resilience"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=In%20search%20of%20resilience&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-06&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Ffh17h0uh6qea4ccvg1qanbk282814uug&amp;type=SR&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
