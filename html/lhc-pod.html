In the first of two episodes, host Alok Jha travels to the Franco-Swiss border to find out what the particle accelerator could reveal about the fundamental building blocks of the universe. </p><p class="article__body-text">In 2012, the LHC discovered the Higgs boson, the final piece of the Standard Model of particle physics. But physicists know that that theory is incomplete—it does not account for gravity, dark energy or dark matter, and cannot explain why there seems to be more matter than antimatter. In its third run of experiments, we investigate how the LHC might change our understanding of physics at its most fundamental scales.

We also investigate the <a href="./finding-new-physics-will-require-a-new-particle-collider.html">long-term future of particle colliders</a>. Will scientists ever build the instruments required to reveal the true building blocks of the universe?

By recreating conditions as close as possible to the Big Bang, it might provide answers to some of physics’s greatest mysteries. <a href="./experiments-contradicting-the-standard-model-are-piling-up.html">Recent findings</a> have shown chinks in the armour of the Standard Model of particle physics, currently scientists’ best <a href="./21803916.html">understanding of the universe</a> at its smallest scales. Through the lens of an intriguing anomalous result, host Alok Jha investigates the new theories that might supersede the Standard Model.
