Diggers load loose rock into 320-tonne driverless trucks which carry it to a conveyor belt. They pass by a dam built to hold back the Asana river in case it overflows the tunnel which carries it for almost eight kilometres beneath Quellaveco. This is a new $5.5bn copper mine operated by Anglo American, a London-listed multinational mining company, and part-owned by Mitsubishi of Japan.</p><p class="article__body-text">The diggers and trucks are “pre-mining”, stripping away surface rock to expose the copper ore below. Nearby, workers are putting the finishing touches to the plant which will extract the metal from its ore. In the next few weeks mining proper will start. It has taken more than a decade to get to this stage. With blanket Wi-Fi as well as its driverless trucks, Quellaveco is perhaps the most technologically advanced mine in Latin America. It is also a test of whether big mining has a future in a country and region in which social conflict threatens to banish extractive industries.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Channelling the river past the mine, so that it emerges untouched downstream, was a condition for Quellaveco to gain an environmental licence and local consent. So was a new reservoir, built by Anglo at 5,500 metres on the headwaters of another river 90km away. The mine will use just 4m of the reservoir’s 60m cubic metres of water. The rest will go to farmers lower down, providing them with a reliable water supply they previously lacked. The mine will depend upon water from a third river which is naturally suffused with heavy metals.</p><p class="article__body-text">Other commitments came from 18 months of talks between the company, local officials and community groups convened in 2011 by Martín Vizcarra, the governor of the Moquegua region, who later became Peru’s president. Anglo agreed to pay for a $1bn development fund, to be spent over the 30-year life of the mine, and to fund small community projects. Perhaps its most important commitment was to hire local people, many of whom it has trained, and to give opportunities to local suppliers. Of the mine’s permanent workforce of 2,500, the company says 71% are from Moquegua and 28% are women (compared with an average of 10% at mines in Peru). </p><p class="article__body-text">“The key is that people can see something beyond tomorrow,” says Hugh Elliott, a British diplomat who worked for Anglo American and was involved in the talks. “You can build sustainable livelihoods if you do it right.” That is where other big mines have run into problems. Chinese-owned Las Bambas has been shut for weeks after local communities occupied parts of it. When they surrendered their land for the project, they received new houses, plots elsewhere and at least $100,000 in cash per family. Now the money has been spent and they find it hard to adapt to a more urban life. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">That is one explanation. The other is that activists are attempting to extort more money from mines, egged on by Vladimir Cerrón, an ally of Cuba whose Free Peru party controls Pedro Castillo, the president. Under Mr Castillo, conflicts over mining have increased sharply. Protesters recently forced a two-month closure at Cuajone, a much older copper mine near Quellaveco. They were demanding $5bn.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mining is vital for Peru. Over the past decade it has provided 59% of export income and 10% of total tax revenues, according to the Instituto Peruano de Economía, a think-tank. Quellaveco will boost its output of copper by 10-12%. The metal is vital to green-economy products such as electric cars.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mining companies have often been insensitive to their surroundings. But many of their problems stem from the weakness of government, both national and local. Their taxes don’t necessarily translate into benefits for local communities. Anglo was fortunate that Mr Vizcarra, a poor president but an effective governor, was determined to make dialogue work. That created stakeholders with an interest in the mine’s success. </p><p class="article__body-text">But Quellaveco now faces the tricky transition from construction, which at its peak involved 15,000 workers, to its much smaller operational staff. “It’s very different from ten or 30 years ago, it’s not just about a mining business where you try to be efficient,” says Adolfo Heeren, Anglo American’s boss in Peru. “You have to renew your social licence every day.” That costs more upfront. But if it allows continuous operation, it saves money in the long run.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Read more from Bello, our columnist on Latin America:</b><br/><i><a data-tegid="7pvtriv74704a34g25qba1ol8t11759j" href="./latin-americas-divisions-over-defending-democracy.html">Latin America’s divisions over defending democracy</a> (May 21st)</i><br/><i><a href="./the-front-runner-for-colombias-election-faces-death-threats.html">The front-runner for Colombia’s election faces death threats</a> (May 7th)</i><br/><i><a href="./brazils-presidential-election-in-october-will-be-about-the-economy.html">Brazil’s presidential election in October will be about the economy</a> (Apr 2nd)</i></p></div></body></html>
