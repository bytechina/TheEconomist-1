It was the first such departure since Russia invaded Ukraine in February—and a test for a deal signed by the two countries on July 22nd to <a href="./odessas-port-may-soon-be-reopened.html">reopen Ukraine’s ports</a> for food exports. Oleksandr Kubrakov, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, said the ship’s departure was “another step towards preventing world hunger”. The deal is designed to alleviate a global food crisis; the <small>UN</small> says 50m are on the brink of famine. António Guterres, the <small>UN</small>’s secretary-general, called the agreement a “beacon in the Black Sea”. Will the reopening of Ukraine’s ports relieve global hunger?</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/3086/90/media-assets/image/20220730_WOC357.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="336px" src="../image/20220730_WOC357.png" srcset="../image/20220730_WOC357.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The reopening should in theory allow Ukraine to export about 5m tonnes of food every month (it has been exporting perhaps 2m tonnes over land and down the Danube river, both far more restricted routes than the Black Sea). Some 20m tonnes of grain have been stuck at Ukraine’s ports. Another 60m is expected to be available for export after this summer’s harvest. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 40 countries—including many of the world’s poorest—rely on Ukraine and Russia for more than 30% of their wheat imports. Some, such as Eritrea and Somalia, depend on them for nearly all their wheat imports (see chart).</p><p class="article__body-text">The resumption of grain exports might also help to further rein in global food prices, which have been cooling in recent months. The UN’s Food Price Index declined for the third consecutive month in June largely because of increased cereal output. A bumper harvest in Australia and favourable crop conditions in other wheat-producing countries had already brought down the price of wheat to just above pre-war levels. The announcement of the grain deal pushed it below that benchmark.</p><p class="article__body-text">Yet uncertainties abound. For one, although the deal has begun to work it is unclear whether Russia will stick to its side of the bargain. Just a day after the deal was signed Russian missiles struck Odessa; there was another strike on Mykolaiv, another Black Sea port, days later. Such attacks may happen again. Moving the grain also presents logistical challenges. Other shipping companies and insurers may still be reluctant to get involved. Ports damaged by the war may not be operating at full capacity. Ships will need to follow a set path to avoid mines laid by Ukraine to thwart Russian naval attacks.</p><p class="article__body-text">If the deal starts to wobble, food prices may nudge up again; after the attacks on Odessa, for example, wheat prices leapt. The uncertainty adds to other long-term risks. The prices of agricultural inputs, such as fuel and fertiliser, remain high. Supply chains are snarled, partly because of the lingering effect of covid-19. Climate change, through severe heatwaves and droughts, threatens to constrain grain supply and drive up prices. Misguided government responses, such as export controls and stockpiling, are adding to the pressure. Moreover, the roots of hunger in many poor countries extend far beyond the war in Ukraine. Local conflicts, such as those in Ethiopia, <a href="./somalia-is-on-the-brink-of-starvation.html">Somalia</a> and Yemen, are causing starvation; economic collapse in <a href="./why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil.html">Sri Lanka</a> has left many formerly middle-class citizens skipping meals. In these places, the beacon of the Black Sea may seem too distant. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves.html">The increase in simultaneous heatwaves</a><br/><a href="./where-will-ukraine-store-its-grain.html">Where will Ukraine store its grain?</a><br/><a href="./what-is-stagflation-and-might-it-make-a-comeback.html">What is stagflation, and might it make a comeback?</a></p></div></body></html>
