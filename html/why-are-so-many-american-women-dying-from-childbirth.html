As late as the 1930s, one out of every 100 live births in the United States cost a woman her life; similar rates were seen around the world. But the 20th century brought tremendous advances in obstetric medicine and widened access to decent care. The maternal-mortality rate plummeted in rich countries by as much as 99%, and <a data-tegid="nvqa87qu7d00brd7vtainsbn00d29ti7" href="./maternal-and-child-mortality.html">now poor countries</a> are <a data-tegid="nuh7urf5duq404h5lkmtge575jp9buop" href="./the-best-story-in-development.html">starting to catch up</a>. But in America something odd is happening: over the past quarter of a century, the maternal-mortality rate (which counts deaths within 42 days after delivery) has been creeping back up. In 2013 more than 18 women died for every 100,000 live births. America is one of only eight countries, including Afghanistan and South Sudan, where these numbers are moving in the wrong direction. What is going on?</p><p class="article__body-text">Some speculate that it has to do with the fact that American women tend to be both fatter and older when they become pregnant these days—and the risks associated with childbirth rise in tandem with weight and age. But similar trends can be seen in plenty of countries where the death rates are still coming down. Others suggest optimistically that America has become more rigorous about counting these deaths. The problem with this theory is that the system for collecting these records hasn’t changed much over the past decade, yet the rate has continued to rise.</p></div></body></html>
