But that is where they stand in covid booster vaccinations: 4.1% of the population have had an extra jab, just behind Romania at 5%. They started on November 18th, months after other countries. “It is impossible to explain,” says Roel Coutinho, a former head of the national outbreak-management team. He blames the Dutch culture of governing via exhaustive negotiations and consensus—a system known as the “polder model”.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-dutch-style-of-government-good-for-dykes-bad-for-covid.mp3" title="The Dutch style of government: good for dykes, bad for covid"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Indeed, almost nine months after elections last March, the country has no new government. For months the ruling centre-right Liberal party locked horns with one of its junior partners, the centre-left <small>D</small>66 party, which wanted more leftist outfits in the coalition. <small>D</small>66 backed down, but an agreement is only now nearing completion.</p><p class="article__body-text">The Dutch call such lengthy consultations <em>polderen</em> on the theory that they stem from the country’s history of land and water management. Maintaining polders in a sea-level landscape requires agreements to fix dykes and canals, even between opposing parties. In Dutch government, the polder model means that policy is set in years-long discussions with trade unions, industry associations, housing societies, cyclists—every stakeholder imaginable.

Dutch infrastructure and pensions are among the best in the world. But it can be disastrous in a crisis such as a pandemic. Decisions over curfews and vaccine passports are interminably delayed by debates between interest groups and government bodies.
