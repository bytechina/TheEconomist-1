They planned to go highlining: stringing cables over vertiginous drops to walk across for fun and fame on Instagram. They had been on guerrilla missions to Chernobyl before and on the evening of February 23rd they camped on the 15th floor of a building in Pripyat, the town that had been abandoned after the reactor exploded in 1986. They woke early the following day, planning to secure their cable between two of the tallest blocks of flats.</p><p class="article__body-text">They heard the first bombs just before 5am. Missiles arced overhead and the outlines of fighter jets shot across the dark sky. They knew they had to get out. They arrived at the first checkpoint outside Pripyat to see the tail lights of a car driving away. None of Chernobyl’s special police were at the second checkpoint, only civilian security guards, who looked unsure of things. As it started to get light, an air-raid siren sounded. The guards told them that they’d better go to the main administration building.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">At 8am Valentin Geiko, who was in charge of the shift at the power plant, issued an emergency alert. He telephoned the heads of department on site, to tell them about reports of explosions across Ukraine and sightings of Russian planes above Chernobyl. Anton Kutenko, who worked in nuclear-waste management, called his wife, who was looking after their two small sons. “When are you coming home?” she asked him. “I don’t know,” he replied.</p><p class="article__body-text">The night shift was supposed to end at 9am when a train would take workers back to Slavutych, the dormitory town that served the power station. By accident of history and geography, that railway line runs through a sliver of Belarus, the country from which Russia launched the invasion (the train doesn’t stop there and no passport checks are required). News soon came through that part of the track had been removed and the road bridge over the Dnieper river had been blown up. The rotation of shifts had been cancelled. There were 103 staff on duty at the station. No one was going home.</p><p class="article__body-text">A little later, four young men appeared at the front entrance of the main building, carrying GoPro cameras, utility knives and a drone. They said they’d been camping and asked to be evacuated. Valeriy Semenov, the head of security, was inclined to believe their story, though he told them, only half-joking, that they looked like a bunch of saboteurs. But he knew they had no hope of getting out. There were already reports of Russian tanks to the south. He decided to lock them in the basement.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>Chernobyl is a symbol of a great failure. It is also a place of courage, sacrifice and endeavour</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Air-raid sirens wailed for the rest of the day. Most staff were ordered to the bunker beneath the main building. Kutenko stayed with a single colleague in front of his bank of monitors, which displayed the temperature, moisture levels and air pressure of the different containment facilities.</p><p class="article__body-text">At 4.15pm Semenov noticed a blur moving rapidly across one of the 25 screens in front of him. It was heading from the border with Belarus. “I could tell by the shape and the amount of dust that it was a heavy military vehicle,” Semenov told me. Another amorphous shape followed, then the clear contours of three armoured personnel-carriers and a convoy of trucks. On another screen Semenov saw men in black uniforms disembark at a checkpoint.</p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KR4ag7WJcc?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">Within three minutes Russian troops were at the gates. They drew up outside the building in their vehicles, which included a tank. Looking at the <small>CCTV</small> footage, Semenov called Geiko to report that nine intruders were breaking through the main turnstile. “Yes, I can see them through the window,” Geiko said. “They are pointing their guns at me.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">C</span>hernobyl is a symbol of a great failure. It is also a place of courage, sacrifice and endeavour. Those who work there feel proud and affectionate towards this strange, dangerous place. They are protective of the memory of the accident and those who died in it as well as the principle of renewal that the site now represents. People were poisoned there and forced to abandon it. In their absence, it has become a kind of Eden, where nature has healed itself. The woods teem with bears, moose and wolves, and the forest has encroached on the deserted town.</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Reactor number 4 exploded on April 26th 1986. It was the worst nuclear accident in history, in terms of deaths and the cost of clean-up. The blast melted the nuclear fuel, burned through the reactor casing and fused into a glassy mass of nuclear lava. More than 130 fire fighters and engineers ended up in hospital with acute-radiation syndrome, and 30 of them died. In the aftermath, reactor 4 was covered in a concrete sarcophagus weighing around 30,000 tonnes to contain the radioactivity. An exclusion zone created with a radius of 30km – half in Ukraine, half in Belarus – is one of the places on Earth most contaminated by radiation. The fallout caused cancer and birth defects. The normal background radiation in Ukraine can reach up to 300 nanosieverts per hour; within the zone the count hovers around 10,000 nanosieverts per hour.</p><p class="article__body-text">In the months after the explosion, thousands of engineers and workers came from all over the Soviet Union to help the clean-up. These people, known as “liquidators”, were hailed as heroes. Since Pripyat was uninhabitable, a new town, Slavutych, was built to house the newcomers and the staff of the plant. (The other reactors were undamaged and Chernobyl continued to operate as a power station until it was decommissioned in 2000.)</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/950/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_02.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="950" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_02.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_02.jpg" width="1424"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/959/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_03.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="959" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_03.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_03.jpg" width="1424"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/950/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_04.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="950" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_04.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_04.jpg" width="1424"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_05.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_05.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_05.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Power move</b> Russian soldiers occupied Chernobyl nuclear-power station for 38 days (<i>opening image</i>).

It was built as a co-operative endeavour between the various republics of the Soviet Union: architects from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania and Uzbekistan, as well as Russia and Ukraine, designed different districts. </p><p class="article__body-text">But the clean-up is ongoing. The power station currently employs 2,600 people – cooks, engineers, medics, security guards – and approximately 6,000 more work in the offices and laboratories, as well as the hostels and shops that service them. There are also two fire stations based in the exclusion zone, for emergencies in the power plant and to tackle summertime forest fires. Before the pandemic, more than 100,000 tourists visited each year – according to one tour guide, you can safely spend between one and five days in Pripyat, depending on the ambient levels of radiation. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">“It is the past, the present and the future,” said Kateryna Shavanova, a biologist who has conducted research in Chernobyl for the past ten years. “There is a statue of Lenin, the Soviet-era dormitories we stay in…And then there is this new arch over the destroyed reactor which is really cutting-edge technology.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">T</span>he week before Ukraine was invaded, the number of soldiers deployed at Chernobyl doubled in number to over 170. After the Russians arrived, the Ukrainians all lined up to surrender their weapons. Meanwhile, negotiations for control of the plant began. Geiko, Semenov and two army commanders represented the Ukrainians; the Russian negotiators included a general and a colonel. Semenov observed that the general’s cheek twitched with what seemed like tension.</p><p class="article__body-text">Geiko explained that Chernobyl was a uniquely hazardous installation because of the many sources of radiation around the site. He insisted that he and his Ukrainian staff retain operational control. Bargaining continued for almost three hours. Throughout, Semenov could hear the mechanical grinding of a military convoy heading south towards Kyiv. </p><p class="article__body-text">The Ukrainians knew that a shoot-out inside the plant could be catastrophic: equipment might be damaged and essential technicians injured. They also understood that they were now far behind enemy lines. There was no chance of the Ukrainian army liberating them.</p><p class="article__body-text">Semenov proposed that Russian soldiers be given access to the administration building and a few other areas. “We wanted to close the plant to them as much as we could.” In particular, he needed to keep them away from the energy blocks, a series of buildings used to service the defunct reactors. “It’s the cockpit,” he explained, “the area you want to keep terrorists out of.”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>Semenov’s whole life since early childhood had prepared him for his role under the occupation</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Geiko and Semenov wore the Russians down with descriptions of protocols, contingencies and dire warnings. They convinced them that the plant’s safety couldn’t be guaranteed if guns were allowed in operational areas. “We achieved our negotiation goals. They were living with us under our rules,” Semenov said. They issued 170 passes to Russians but only 15 of them were granted access to the area housing nuclear waste. There were so many soldiers lying down in the corridor that Semenov had to step over them to get to the toilet. </p><p class="article__body-text">At that point, Semenov remembered the highliners in the basement. He went downstairs and unlocked the door. “There has been a change of regime,” he announced: “The Russians have taken the facility.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">V</span>aleriy Semenov is a limber, energetic and garrulous man in his late 40s with a raw-boned face and a big, broad smile. He was born near the city of Saratov: “I don’t want to say Russia, because back then it was the USSR.” The town he grew up in was poor; he remembers a local shop with “empty fridges and three pomegranates and the skeleton of a cow with no meat left on the bones.” When Semenov was 13, his parents moved to Slavutych to work as liquidators. Following them, at the age of 18, he himself joined a crew cleaning up radioactive waste. His supervisor was Valentin Geiko, with whom he would run the plant under Russian occupation nearly 30 years later. He has now spent all his own working life at Chernobyl: he has degrees in engineering and physics, and has served in most departments at the station – fuel storage, nuclear-waste management, radiation monitoring and, finally, security. </p><p class="article__body-text">I met Semenov in Slavutych four days after he returned from Chernobyl. His whole life since early childhood, he said, had prepared him for his role under the occupation. Though he was exhausted, his story poured out of him. He’d snatched a pen and paper to draw diagrams of the site: “The administration building was here, you see, my building – no I cannot tell you the name of my building. It is secret! – was here.” Sometimes he’d pace the room, gesticulating to explain technical points, measuring distances with his hands.</p><p class="article__body-text">I talked to Semenov over several days in April. During that period the Ukrainian secret service was also debriefing him. “But with you I have to filter it a little,” he winked. “Some things are national-security matters.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span>n the first days of the occupation, Russians tried to use their passes to open all kinds of doors and gates. Semenov said he told them, “Look at the photographs on the walls if you want to see something. If you want some nuclear waste I can put some in your pocket!”</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_06.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_06.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_06.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1694/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_07.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1694" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_07.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_07.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1707/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_08.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="1707" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_08.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_08.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Keeping the faith</b> Ukrainian special forces enjoy the only bar open in Slavutych (<i>top</i>).

None of them displayed insignia or ranks on their uniforms.</p><p class="article__body-text">The soldiers stationed at the power station behaved with restraint; those based in nearby labs and admin buildings spent the occupation looting and vandalising. They stole excavators, forestry equipment, specialised vehicles used for moving nuclear waste and any cars they could find. They ransacked labs and offices, ripped out servers and scooped up laptops, cameras and projection equipment. They took electric kettles and alarm clocks from rooms at the hostels and cutlery from the canteens. The occupiers also dug trenches around the Red Forest, a highly contaminated area where much of the radioactive debris once landed. </p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Several officials arrived from RosAtom, a Russian state-owned nuclear-energy company. Semenov got the sense that their status was even higher than the generals’. He saw them remove boxes from the site a couple of times. “I have no idea what they were doing,” he said, laughing. “I think they were looking for those American biological-weapons labs” (a staple of Russian propaganda). </p><p class="article__body-text">Kutenko, who is in his 30s, with a broad, handsome face and a close-shaven head and beard, told me that although staff had been trained for fire and floods, earthquakes and radiation leaks, there were no procedures in the eventuality of an invasion.</p><p class="article__body-text">It was clear that the Russians were under orders not to harass the plant’s staff, he said. The Ukrainians generally avoided the Russians but occasionally they’d ask them, “What are you doing here? What do you want here? Why don’t you just go home!” The soldiers usually mumbled and walked off. Sometimes they would say that they’d come to free Ukraine from radicals or simply said that they were following orders.</p><p class="article__body-text">Semenov warned his staff not to risk a confrontation or even take pictures on their phones. “I had to keep everything calm and stable. I didn’t want to provoke them. It was very important to keep their trust.” He saw his primary duty as “balancing the safety of the plant and the personnel”. He understood that the staff were angry at the occupiers. “There were difficult moments…People – Ukrainians – were ready to do anything.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The Russian troops had expected their “special operation” to be brief. Soldiers had brought scant supplies: one admitted that he’d packed only a single uniform, because he thought he was on a training exercise. Some asked Semenov where they could buy cigarettes. “They said, ‘Why are there no shops near here?’ I said, ‘This is a restricted zone!’ They didn’t understand where they were.”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>“If you want some nuclear waste I can put some in your pocket!”</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">The Ukrainians exaggerated the threat of radiation to stymie Russian efforts to impose greater control. They would warn them to stay away from certain “problematic areas”. “That was the cheeky plan,” said Kutenko, “but it worked.” At the same time, they did nothing to stop the Russians endangering themselves. In the first few days of the war a long convoy of vehicles travelling towards Kyiv kicked up a large amount of dust and Kutenko’s team recorded elevated levels of radiation. “It was higher than normal, but not at any catastrophic level. It was in the safety margins,” he said. “Did you tell the Russians?” I asked him. He smiled. “No.”</p><p class="article__body-text">In Slavutych, the families of the Chernobyl workers struggled to call their relatives at the plant. Mobile-phone reception in Chernobyl was blocked (it is unclear by whom), though you could get patchy coverage if you climbed onto the roof of the power station. Communication with the outside world was largely reduced to a landline connection with the power-plant administration office in Slavutych. Semenov told me that he tried to pass on as much information about Russian manoeuvres and overheard conversations as he could. He asked one of his team to count military vehicles. Unusually, Kutenko had a landline in his office that could call mobile numbers. Several members of the Ukrainian National Guard asked him to phone their relatives. “Their family members had different reactions,” Kutenko said. “Some didn’t believe who I was and so would ask me trick questions or to pronounce a Ukrainian word. Some wept. Some thanked me.”</p><p class="article__body-text">In Slavutych, the plant’s administrators made their landlines available to the families. Semenov’s wife, Olga, kept her daily calls brief. She didn’t want to bother him with reports of food shortages or her own worries. The couple are coming up to their 30th wedding anniversary. “We had never been separated for such a long time,” Semenov told me.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">E</span>ach day brought new problems. Semenov became the point man for negotiating with the Russians. His expansive manner and ready humour smoothed over awkward situations. “Geiko was the head”, he said, “and I was the hands.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The line between co-operation and collaboration felt wire-thin. Semenov found it hard to attune himself simultaneously to the feelings of the Ukrainians and the Russians. More than once, Russian soldiers tried to enter areas which their commanders agreed they would keep out of. “I had to predict any change of mood. I had to think one or two steps ahead. But I have a very philosophical point of view. I talked to everyone. I don’t know if this is good or bad.”</p><p class="article__body-text">He had to defuse several confrontations. One afternoon Russian soldiers started firing into the air, apparently trying to shoot down drones. On another occasion the Russians organised a press junket, arriving with boxes of humanitarian aid to give to Ukrainians in front of <small>TV</small> cameras. The Ukrainians refused to accept them. Semenov couldn’t stop himself from suggesting to the Russian journalists that they “ask our civilians if we have been waiting for you to come with your good intentions to free us from radicalism”.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/950/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_23.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="950" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_23.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_23.jpg" width="1424"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_09.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_09.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_09.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_11_REV.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_11_REV.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_11_REV.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/868/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_12.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="868" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_12.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_12.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Staff slept in their offices. Semenov shared a camp bed and two sleeping bags with five colleagues. “Certainly you didn’t sleep as well as if you were at home,” Kutenko said. “I don’t know if it was the stress or because we were sleeping on benches and chairs. Or because of the noise – the ventilation fans were loud, the monitors were blinking and beeping.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Every day, workers visited the medical clinic. Most complaints were related to stress: cramps, constipation, eczema, haemorrhoids. Kutenko was told that his blood pressure was high, and tried to read a detective novel to take his mind off things (it didn’t work). Like Semenov, he was constantly aware of being responsible for the physical and mental well-being of his staff. “It was a serious situation,” he said. “There could be no mistakes. We’re not a milk factory.”</p><p class="article__body-text">There was enough food in the power station to last several weeks. Staff trooped to the dining room twice a day for borscht, meat, cabbage salad, buckwheat and cheesecake. They had everything except for fresh bread. A few days in, one of the three cooks collapsed from exhaustion. The four highliners who’d been locked in the basement were brought out to help. “I can’t say we were cooking,” said Kostya Karnoza, an easygoing 20-something who, when not walking across wires, works in tech. “We were chopping vegetables and washing dishes.” </p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-5"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Occasionally they chatted to the Russian soldiers, who ate separately, during cigarette breaks. “Their first questions to us were, ‘Where are the <small>NATO</small> bases? Where are the Banderites [right-wing nationalists] making all the trouble?’” said Kostya. Troops boasted that Kyiv would be taken in three days. When the Russian advance stalled, they argued that they were fighting a fearsome army of American soldiers, French Foreign Legionnaires and criminals whom Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, had supposedly freed from prison. “They asked us, ‘Why doesn’t the Ukrainian government just surrender? Don’t they want peace?’” Some admitted that they didn’t know why they were there. The Russians were surprised to learn from personnel files that many employees, the children of liquidators who carried out the clean-up, had been born in Russia.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>One Russian soldier had brought a single uniform with him because he thought he was on a training exercise</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">The highliners are entrepreneurs and software developers, members of a resourceful new generation of Ukrainians.

According to Olena Pareniuk, a researcher at Chernobyl, it is unlikely but not inconceivable that, as the lava continues to decay, a shift in the composition of its elements could set off a chain reaction.</p><p class="article__body-text">There are other risks too. Some 22,000 spent fuel rods, left over from when the reactors were in use, are still hot. If they aren’t cooled correctly they could burn through their containers and leak radiation. The rods have been kept underwater and are now in the process of being transferred elsewhere to be stored, more safely, under helium. So far only 12% have been removed. </p><p class="article__body-text">A further hazard comes from the radioactive nuclear waste that Chernobyl recycles (a somewhat euphemistic term) from its own defunct reactors and Ukraine’s four operational nuclear-power stations. Most of this waste is stored in metal drums buried in concrete. If the drums are moved about, they might be damaged and leak. The contents could even be used to make a dirty bomb</p><p class="article__body-text">Three high-voltage lines serve Chernobyl. Technicians need electricity to monitor and cool the nuclear detritus. If the power goes down the risks of a leak rise. I asked Pareniuk which threat was the greatest. She shakes her head: “It is like you are asking what organ in your body is most at risk when you stop breathing.”</p><p class="article__body-text">On March 9th the electricity to the power station went out. No one knows why. Perhaps it was damaged in the fighting or caused by sabotage. There were back-up generators but the fuel would last only 24 hours. The Ukrainians told the Russians that there was only enough for 12. “If there is an accident,” Semenov said to one officer, “you are responsible.”</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_13.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_13.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_13.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_14.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_14.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_14.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/960/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_15.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="960" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_15.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_15.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/963/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_16.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="963" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_16.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_16.jpg" width="1280"/></div><figcaption><b>Blast from the past</b> (<i>from top to bottom</i>) Slavutych has a museum about the Chernobyl explosion in 1986.

They worked in a windowless building mixing radioactive water with cement and hardening it in steel drums. The most dangerous part, he told me, was cleaning the concrete mixers.</p><p class="article__body-text">The day the Russians occupied the plant, a batch of 16 barrels was ready for removal. The ventilation system that cooled the nuclear waste stopped when the electricity went off. It took three days to work out how to connect it to a generator. During this time, radiation levels probably rose – it was impossible to tell, though, because, after four weeks, the Ukrainians had been unable to replace the dosimeters used to take measurements. </p><p class="article__body-text">Electricians were sent to repair the line. The area outside the exclusion zone was hard to navigate: Russian and Ukrainian checkpoints were interspersed; sporadic fighting took place. There were misunderstandings between Russian soldiers and the Ukrainian electricians. The electricians first refused a Russian military escort, then demanded one. Several attempts were made to fix the problem but the damage was hard to locate and to reach; it was unclear if there was one break or several. At around lunchtime on the third day of the outage, the power was restored for two and a half hours. Just 15 minutes after Ukrainian <small>TV </small>announced that the plant was back online, the electricity went off again.</p><p class="article__body-text">Staff had to prioritise supply: electric heaters and extraneous equipment were turned off. Kutenko’s team slept in their parkas. “We were unlucky, it was very cold at that time, down to minus eight at night,” he said. They “were very smelly, because we were working hard and sweating”, but hot showers were deemed a wasteful luxury.</p><p class="article__body-text">The hungry generators required almost constant replenishment – every three hours during the day, every five at night. Russian troops brought in diesel tankers, but the nozzles of their petrol guns were too wide to fit into the generators so the fuel had to be decanted into 200-litre oil drums before being transferred. “We hand-pumped it, so that helped us to warm up a bit,” said Kutenko.</p><p class="article__body-text">There was no power in Slavutych either, where the families of the Chernobyl workers lived. But this is a town of engineers and they soon reconditioned an old petrol station, which gave them heating. Cables were attached to solar panels on the roof of the museum so people could charge their phones and connect, falteringly, to the internet. Locals chopped firewood and fashioned brick barbecues in their gardens. “In this war all of our people became united, we became family,” Father Ioan, the town’s Orthodox priest, told me. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>“There could be no mistakes. We’re not a milk factory”</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Every tanker that kept Chernobyl operating was being redirected from the Russian army stalled near Kyiv. Finally, Russian patience wore thin. A general declared that Chernobyl was drawing too much petrol from the front line and told Geiko that they’d have to connect to the grid in Belarus. Geiko recognised this as a symbolic defeat but had no choice – the danger of not doing so was too great. He insisted on one condition: if Chernobyl got electricity from Belarus, so must Slavutych. </p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">R</span>eports of the faltering assault on Kyiv filtered back to Russians stationed at Chernobyl. A few soldiers wanted to watch the <small>TV</small> news. They couldn’t understand Ukrainian but they could see the footage of burnt tanks and the bodies of Russian soldiers. In hushed tones, some said they didn’t know what they were doing in Chernobyl.</p><p class="article__body-text">Even their leaders expressed doubts. On one occasion, Semenov watched a Russian bomber fly overhead as he smoked a cigarette. He waved his fist at it, shouting, “Pederasti!” (“Faggots!”). The soldiers nearby asked him why he was shouting. “They are not going to bomb with sweets and cookies!” he replied. Later a Russian officer confided, “I don’t like these pederasti either.”</p><p class="article__body-text">After two weeks, the troops at Chernobyl were sent south towards Kyiv. They got drunk the night before they left. Some complained that they were being marched towards “certain death”. When a new garrison arrived, the remnants of a marine battalion that had been fighting near Kyiv, the tyres of their vehicles were so shredded that Semenov was surprised they were able to drive. At the plant, they collapsed spread-eagled on the grass, exhausted. One commander told Semenov not to let his staff antagonise them; they had lost too many comrades. </p><p class="article__body-text">Three weeks into the occupation, Semenov went to find a cache of biscuits and sweets and came across an officer called Tikhomirov, who was drunk. He spun the chamber of his revolver, pointed the gun at Semenov and pulled the trigger. There was a click but no bang. Semenov avoided him after this incident, but laughed as he retold the story: first because this Russian actually played Russian roulette; second because Tikhomirov translates as “quiet peace”.</p><p class="article__body-text">On March 20th, after 25 days of occupation, the Russians allowed most Ukrainian staff at Chernobyl to be rotated out (Semenov remained as his counterparts were either besieged in Chernihiv, had small children or had joined the Territorial Defence Forces). “I was so happy to leave,” Kutenko told me. Because the bridge over the Dnieper had been destroyed, workers had to be ferried across. Some of the sailors who worked on the boats saw this service as collaboration and refused to take part.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_17.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_17.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_17.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_18.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_18.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_18.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/854/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_19.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="854" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_19.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_19.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/872/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_20.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="872" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_20.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220510_CHERNOBYL_20.jpg" width="1280"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">The highliners were among the first to cross to Slavutych. As they waited on the river bank, a Russian officer began eulogising about how there was no Russia or Ukraine, only a Soviet Union, and how the Americans always brought war but the Russians brought peace. “He was driving a Ford pickup he had looted from the National Guard,” said Kostya. “And at the exact moment he said the word ‘peace’, a great barrage of missiles flew over heading in the direction of Chernihiv.”</p><p class="article__body-text">It was almost midnight when Kutenko finally arrived in Slavutych. The street lights were off and the windows dark. Kutenko had grown a beard over the preceding weeks. His youngest son, a toddler, didn’t recognise him. “He hid behind his mother. It was like some strange guy had shown up.”</p><div class="adComponent_advert__Zm3SL adComponent_incontent__2NeL8 adComponent_hidden__2l1Bb advert--inline"><div><div class="adComponent_adcontainer__3UKZz" id="econ-6"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">T</span>he Russians were pushing closer to Slavutych. On March 22nd Russian forces issued an ultimatum for the town to surrender by 3pm the next day. In the first week of the war, Yuri Fomichev, the town’s 46-year-old mayor, formed a territorial-defence unit, bolstering the 50 local policemen with 150 volunteers – “basically the number of rifles we had”. But there were no heavy weapons in Slavutych nor hope of military support. </p><p class="article__body-text">On March 23rd, the Russians tentatively advanced, firing off several volleys at the outermost checkpoint on the road into Slavutych. The following day the “shooting really started”, says Fomichev. Both checkpoints were destroyed, killing at least three people. Fomichev himself was detained by Russian soldiers who he found oddly deferential. One asked him for a selfie. “My hands were tied and he was pointing a gun at me,” he recalled, “but it was as if he still respected my authority because I was the mayor.”</p><p class="article__body-text">As Fomichev was being interrogated, the Russians watched drone footage of a protest fomenting in Slavutych. Fomichev suggested that he could help calm things down. A crowd of 5,000 had gathered, among them the four highliners who had been unable to leave the town. The crowd unfurled a giant Ukrainian flag and chanted, “No to the occupiers!” Around 50 Russian soldiers stood in front of armoured cars and tanks, shooting tear-gas and bullets into the air to disperse the crowd. </p><p class="article__body-text">Father Ioan took up his tall processional cross and joined the protest. He had just received the sacrament and was “not afraid to die”, he told me. He ran towards the Russian soldiers, shouting at them to “take off their crucifixes, because no Christian would advance on civilians pointing guns!”</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite><b>The Russian spun the chamber of his revolver, pointed the gun and pulled the trigger</b></cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Eventually, Fomichev prevailed upon the crowd to withdraw to the main square. Their compliance seemed to quell the Russian anger. After troops had searched the town for Ukrainian soldiers, they agreed to withdraw to a petrol station nearby, where they siphoned off the fuel and looted the kiosk. They left the next day. </p><p class="article__body-text">When news of the fighting in Slavutych reached Chernobyl, Semenov and Geiko threatened to stop co-operating with the Russians unless the attacks ceased. A Russian general denied, increasingly testily, that any of their troops were near the town. Semenov’s relationship with the general had previously been cordial; now it deteriorated. But he had no regrets. “That was our only way to try and help Slavutych.”</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span>n the face of Ukrainian counter-attacks around Kyiv, Russian troops began to withdraw to the Belarus border on March 31st. They took the national guardsmen at Chernobyl with them as prisoners-of-war. The tyres of their vehicles swirled radioactive dust into the air as they retreated (their departure allowed the highliners to get home to Dnipro). After the last Russians left Chernobyl on April 2nd, the Ukrainians ran their flag back up the main flagpole. Semenov found another flag, older and tattered, in a backroom: he washed it, repaired it and raised it outside his building.</p><p class="article__body-text">The custodians of Chernobyl still face enormous challenges. They need to rebuild from scratch the system for monitoring radiation throughout the exclusion zone. The extent of Russian minefields remains unknown. Blown-up animals are already appearing by roadsides. Firefighters won’t be able to tackle forest blazes this summer, for fear of stepping on a mine. </p><p class="article__body-text">Semenov stayed in Chernobyl for another week to oversee a new influx of staff. In a photograph taken at the time he is gaunt and grey-faced with a scruffy beard. When I met him four days later he told me that he couldn’t concentrate and had severe headaches. “It is like emerging from a long and bad dream. Emotionally, I still feel myself there. Like I have to go somewhere and do something.”</p><p class="article__body-text">I asked him what was the worst moment of the ordeal. He told me it came after the Russians retreated. Throughout the occupation, he had worn a medal commemorating the 30th anniversary of the accident. Someone in Slavutych pulled it off his chest, saying he didn’t deserve it. “What he did in my opinion was unfair,” said Semenov, “He had no right.”</p><p class="article__body-text">On April 26th, the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Semenov sent me another photo of himself proudly holding a different medal with a blue-and-yellow ribbon: the Order of Courage, awarded for his service during the occupation of the power plant. The citation was signed by President Zelensky. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>Wendell Steavenson </b>has reported on post-Soviet Georgia, the Iraq war and the Egyptian revolution.
