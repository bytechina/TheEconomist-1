This is in part because the vehicles, which list a shell company on stockmarkets and raise a pot of capital before hunting for a private company to merge with, are often touted by their backers as an alternative to an initial public offering (<small>IPO</small>). Big banks make meaty fees from their <small>IPO</small> businesses. For some, the fact that <small>SPAC</small>s have muscled in is an unwelcome development. As voracious buyers of private firms, though, <small>SPAC</small>s are attracting as much attention among the private-equity (<small>PE</small>) barons on New York’s Park Avenue as on Wall Street.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/the-uneasy-partnership-between-private-equity-and-spacs.mp3" title="The uneasy partnership between private equity and SPACs"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Since the start of 2020 <small>SPAC</small>s have gobbled up almost $200bn in capital. The way they are constructed makes them prone to overpaying for firms. Creators see no compensation unless they strike a deal with a merger target, which must often be done within two years. The founders’ payoff is usually 20% of the shares the <small>SPAC</small> helps issue in the newly public firm, which are given to them for a nominal fee. This means that even if the shares plunge after the shell company merges with its target, the founders are still well compensated. Their incentive is thus to do any deal they can, at lofty prices if necessary.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This tendency to overpay is both a blessing and a curse for <small>PE</small>. If a <small>PE</small> firm is looking to offload one of its portfolio companies, then finding a <small>SPAC</small> to buy it is an attractive prospect. In March Blackstone and <small>CVC</small> Capital Partners, two <small>PE</small> shops, tripled their money when they sold Paysafe, a payments platform, through a <small>SPAC</small> merger led by Bill Foley, an insurance executive. After Blackstone achieved record first-quarter earnings of $1.75bn Jon Gray, its president, noted on an earnings call that <small>SPAC</small>s had emerged as a new exit option.</p><p class="article__body-text">But <small>PE</small> firms also need to purchase private companies for their new funds, ideally at low valuations if they are to make the juicy returns their investors have come to expect. Little is known publicly about the deals that <small>PE</small> firms miss out on, but reports abound of <small>SPAC</small>s bidding 20-50% more for companies than the most optimistic valuations by analysts in <small>PE</small> shops.</p><p class="article__body-text">A further complication in the relationship between blank-cheque vehicles and <small>PE</small> is that some <small>PE</small> giants are setting up <small>SPAC</small>s themselves. Apollo, for instance, has launched five in recent years. That could pose a dilemma: should a target firm be bought through the private arm, to the benefit of the investors in the <small>PE</small> fund, or by the public arm, to the benefit of the investors in the <small>SPAC</small>? The <small>SPAC</small> frenzy might yield juicy returns for <small>PE</small> investors who bought into a fund a decade ago. But tricky choices loom.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Finance &amp; economics section of the print edition under the headline "Frenemies"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=The%20uneasy%20partnership%20between%20private%20equity%20and%20SPACs&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-10&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fado2r0m4m1pj49nt7864q04hcml4lt08&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
