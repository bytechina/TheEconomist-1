At 186 metres, the <i>Moskva</i> was nearly the length of two football pitches. It bristled with sensors, radio jammers and guns. The ship was protected by three layers of air defence: batteries of S-300F and OSA-MA missiles to shoot down threats at long and shorter ranges respectively, and automated AK-630 Gatling guns to throw a wall of lead at anything that got too close. Russia’s defence ministry claims the warship sank after an accidental fire detonated ammunition. But footage of the damaged vessel, which emerged on April 18th, seems to confirm Ukraine’s claim that it <a href="./a-russian-warship-has-sunk-ukraine-claims-it-struck-it.html">struck the ship</a>. How could an underdog have inflicted such a significant naval loss?</p><p class="article__body-text">Ukrainian officials said on April 14th that two Neptune anti-ship missiles had struck the <i>Moskva</i>. American officials corroborated their claims. The warheads were designed and <a href="./21808082.html">manufactured in Ukraine</a>, based on a Russian anti-ship missile known as Kh-35. Neptune missiles, which Ukraine says it fired from a mobile launcher on land, fly low over water. This makes them harder for their targets to detect, particularly at a distance. Hugging the Earth’s curved surface can keep a projectile out of a radar’s line of sight, at least for a while; waves, rain and even mist can interfere with radar pulses. But the Neptunes’ stealth is not matched by their speed. Unlike much anti-ship weaponry, they travel slower than the speed of sound.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The strike’s success appears to have been aided by smart tactics. Shortly before the attack, Ukrainian forces flew Bayraktar TB2 drones near the <i>Moskva</i>, says a colonel in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, who spoke to <i>The Economist</i>. These drones, which are made in Turkey, have been effective against Russian <a href="./21808191.html">armoured vehicles</a> and artillery. Their presence above the ship could therefore be expected to unnerve those onboard and distract radar operators. The colonel, who requested anonymity, claims that the drones misdirected the crew’s attention while collecting targeting information for the missiles.</p><p class="article__body-text">If the drones were able to transmit the <i>Moskva</i>’s position back to the missile, the Neptunes’ radars could have remained off during much of their approach. This would have been a big help. “Illuminating” a warship with targeting radar sets off alarms. According to Pierre-Henri Chuet, a former fighter pilot in the French navy, the missiles’ radars may have been turned on for only the last two or so minutes of a flight lasting five times as long.</p><p class="article__body-text">The sinking of the <i>Moskva </i>also reflects <a href="./21808813.html">Russian shortcomings</a>. The warship<!-- --> appeared to have been operating just 60 nautical miles off Odessa, with limited support from the rest of the fleet, perhaps because Russia underestimated the Ukrainian threat. The design of the ship also made it vulnerable. The 16 silos containing the ship’s P-1000 “Vulcan” anti-ship missiles were particularly exposed. Shrapnel from a Neptune strike may have ignited their rocket fuel or detonated one or more of the warheads.</p><p class="article__body-text">Russia, despite insisting that the <i>Moskva</i> succumbed to an accident, moved the rest of its fleet back from Ukraine’s coastline immediately after the incident. It also launched retaliatory strikes on Ukraine, including on the Neptune factory near Kyiv. But Russia will now find it harder to provide <a href="./curious-case-russias-missing-air-force.html">air defences</a> over its fleet. Turkey has closed the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to additional warships, so a replacement cannot be sent. A Russian amphibious assault on Odessa looks much riskier. And, reckons the colonel, Ukraine’s display of prowess may encourage allies to provide more of the anti-ship missiles that they have promised. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><i>Read more of our recent coverage of the <a href="./ukraine-crisis.html">Ukraine crisis</a>.</i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from The Economist explains:</b><br/><a href="./why-russian-forces-cant-match-ukraines-night-vision-equipment.html">Why Russian forces can’t match Ukraine’s night-vision equipment</a><br/><a href="./what-is-genocide-and-is-russia-committing-it-in-ukraine.html">What is genocide, and is Russia committing it in Ukraine?</a><br/><a href="./why-are-so-many-russian-generals-dying-in-ukraine.html">Why are so many Russian generals dying in Ukraine?</a></p></div></body></html>
