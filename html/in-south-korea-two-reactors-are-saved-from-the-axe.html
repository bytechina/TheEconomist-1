Ten cranes tower overhead but nobody sits in their cabins. The only movement is the whirl of a few fans. Work on the two reactors stopped suddenly in July, after Moon Jae-in, the country’s left-leaning anti-nuclear president, ordered a pause to the project to give a citizen-jury time to consider its merits. “I was a little worried,” admits Ahn Seong-Shik, the civil engineer in charge of building the reactor shells. “But I trusted the Korean people.”</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Ahn’s faith paid off on October 20th, after the jury endorsed the construction of the two reactors, Shin Kori 5 and 6. “It was a very smart decision,” he says. Mr Moon, who has promised to phase out nuclear power, accepted the verdict. It is an unexpected reprieve for a project that Mr Moon had pledged to scrap before he was elected in May. In June, however, he said he wanted to “generate a social consensus” by delegating the final decision to a 471-strong jury picked by a polling company. Its members were given a month to study materials prepared by scientists and activists before debating the project for three days. In the final vote, 60% backed the new reactors, although more than half of them said South Korea should reduce its overall reliance on nuclear energy. Only 10% said the nuclear industry should grow.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Nuclear energy is a divisive issue in South Korea, with voters largely split along party lines. A poll by Gallup Korea in September found that 41% of Koreans favoured scrapping Shin Kori 5 and 6, while 40% backed their construction. Anti-nuclear campaigners have voiced louder concerns since the Fukushima disaster in neighbouring Japan in 2011 and a 5.8 magnitude earthquake last year in the southern city of Gyeongju, close to some of South Korea’s 24 reactors. A corruption scandal in the industry and the revelation in 2012 that some safety certificates for reactor parts were forged amplified their doubts.</p><p class="article__body-text">But the jury was probably swayed by economic arguments. Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, the state-run company in charge of the Shin Kori project, claimed it had already spent 1.6trn won ($1.4bn) on the reactors, which were 30% complete. South Korea is the world’s second biggest importer of liquefied natural gas and its fourth largest importer of coal. Hydroelectric and renewable energy provides only 6% of its electricity. So nuclear, which accounts for 27% of its electricity supply, helps to guard against volatile import prices, says Kerry-Anne Shanks of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. “Nuclear plants are expensive to build but they’re cheap to run,” she says. The industry also argued that axing the reactors would threaten deals to export nuclear technology.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Moon’s U-turn will frustrate his supporters in cities close to the site. But Hahn Kyu-sup of Seoul National University reckons the jury gave Mr Moon an “excuse” to ditch a thorny pledge that could have triggered lawsuits, while enabling him to stick to his overall plan to phase out nuclear energy. The government has already dropped plans to build six more reactors. Mr Ahn’s celebrations could be premature.</p></div></body></html>
