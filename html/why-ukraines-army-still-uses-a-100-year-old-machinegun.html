The Maxim M1910 has a steampunk aesthetic: it weighs 68kg and has an armoured gun shield on a distinctive two-wheeled mount allowing it to be towed behind a vehicle or manoeuvred by the gun crew. Russian media mock these antiques and say the Ukrainians use them because they lack modern weapons. The truth is more complex. </p><p class="article__body-text">As the name suggests, the weapon was introduced in 1910. It is a Russian-made version of the first truly automatic machinegun, which was patented by Hiram Maxim, an American-British inventor, in 1883. Earlier Gatling guns had six barrels which needed to be cranked by hand. In Maxim’s design, the recoil from firing a bullet works the action and loads the next round. One finger on the trigger unleashes a succession of bullets. A water-cooled barrel allows it to keep firing for extended periods. Variants of Maxim’s gun proved a lethally effective tool of slaughter and terror during the late-19th-century heyday of imperialism, allowing small European forces to kill those they were dispossessing by the hundred or thousand. It went on to revolutionise war between European states themselves. </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Modern medium machineguns firing the same 7.62mm ammunition as the M1910 are much lighter and more portable—the current Russian PKM weighs less than a fifth as much. However they lack water cooling. Firing continuously even for a minute can cause the barrel to deform, or the weapon to “cook off”, when bullets fire without the trigger being pulled. </p><p class="article__body-text">In 2016, Ukraine’s defence minister confirmed he had authorised the release of some M1910s from government stocks (the Maxim gun is not standard issue but available when requested, as some territorial defence units have done). An audit in 2012 showed that Ukraine had 35,000 of the weapons in storage, all manufactured between 1920 and 1950. </p><p class="article__body-text">Only a handful of M1910s have been seen in use since Russia invaded in February, but they have reportedly proven effective in fixed defensive positions and fortifications. As well as water cooling allowing sustained fire, their fixed mounts make them easier to aim. A Ukrainian soldier interviewed in 2016 said the M1910 was highly accurate at one kilometre, effective to three kilometres, and he would not swap it for a more modern weapon. Some M1910s have even been modernised, with images on social media showing vintage machineguns with modern electronic “red dot” sights. The gun is not officially in service with any other army, although Russian-backed separatist militias in the <a href="./why-donetsk-and-luhansk-are-at-the-heart-of-the-ukraine-crisis.html">Donbas region</a> also use them, and they have cropped up in conflict zones from Syria to Vietnam.</p><p class="article__body-text">One element of <a href="./russian-propagandists-turn-on-pro-western-traitors.html">Russian propaganda</a> may be accurate: Ukraine’s attempt to develop their own copy of the modern Russian PKM in 2011 was not a success. Troops reported severe problems with the Mayak KM, as it is known, including that it was impossible to aim at targets less than 400 metres away because of a fixture obscuring the sight. The head of armaments of Ukraine’s armed forces admitted in 2016 that there were still problems with the gun but the design was being modified. There is still little sign of the Mayak KM in service. Instead Ukraine has imported a number of foreign machineguns, and Ukrainian mechanics are scavenging guns from destroyed Russian vehicles to convert into infantry weapons. And some troops are still using the trusty M1910. Machineguns remain an essential feature of infantry combat. Just as it was a century ago, the M1910 remains deadly.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i><b>Correction (May 13th 2022): </b>An earlier version of this article said Maxim’s gun used expanding gases to work the action.
