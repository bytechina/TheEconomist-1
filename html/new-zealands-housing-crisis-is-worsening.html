Home-ownership has been a national obsession ever since the British, a people notoriously obsessed with claiming title to piles of bricks, first colonised the Pacific islands. Emigrants left draughty terraced homes for the “Kiwi dream” of a “quarter-acre block”. That fantasy has become increasingly difficult to realise. The average home in Auckland, the commercial capital, now costs NZ$1.4m ($935,000), 35 times the median income.</p><p class="article__body-text">Auckland is at the centre of a house-price boom that is roiling the country. Low interest rates and lashings of fiscal stimulus have sent prices soaring everywhere. But even by those standards New Zealand’s recent gains look stratospheric. Last year its house prices rose by more than a quarter, according to CoreLogic, a business which tracks them. Relative to incomes, New Zealand has the world’s sixth-most expensive houses. House prices are “unsustainable”, warns the central bank, which acted in November to restrict lending to people with smaller deposits.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">This is compounding a housing crisis which has worried Kiwis for decades. New Zealand is “a housing market with an economy attached”, says Shamubeel Eaqub, an independent economist. Adjusted for inflation, its house prices rose by 256% between 2000 and mid-2021, compared with 64% in America and 110% in Britain. A chronic shortage of affordable homes has forced families to sleep in tents and cars. “The situation in New Zealand is dire,” says Matthew, a 52-year-old who does not have a home (he declined to use his surname).</p><p class="article__body-text">This is bad news for the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her Labour party. When she was first elected in 2017 she made lofty pledges to give Kiwis cheap houses. “We can make home ownership possible again,” she promised in a speech which has aged like milk. Since then, the number of applicants waiting for public housing has more than quadrupled to over 24,000. More than half of those are Maori, the country’s indigenous people, who make up just 17% of its population, says Ronji Tanielu of the Salvation Army, a Christian charity. Last year New Zealand’s Human Rights Commission launched an inquiry into the “right to a decent home”, piling pressure on Ms Ardern.</p><p class="article__body-text">Her government has not always helped itself. It promised in 2017 to erect 100,000 affordable houses through a scheme called KiwiBuild. By last May it had slapped up only 1,000. The target has been abandoned.</p><p class="article__body-text">An attempt to house rough sleepers has also backfired. The government has paid motel owners to convert their rooms into “emergency accommodation”. As a result, says Mr Tanielu, “They are shoving single mums next to gang members and drug dealers.” Matthew notes, “There are a lot of people who like the situation. If you want to buy meth, go into emergency housing. But if that is not your interest, it’s a dangerous situation.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Last year he was shuffled between 29 motels and boarding houses. Nine months later, he decided it was a more miserable experience than being homeless. He left to live in a park where at least there was a beach, a shower and a barbecue, he says. He has since found a place through Lifewise, a charity.</p><p class="article__body-text">Ms Ardern argues that the government is “pulling every lever we have available to us”. It has introduced measures to curb speculation and boost supply. It has closed tax loopholes and tightened rules on taxing investors who flip their properties within ten years, up from five. It is funding councils to build infrastructure for new developments and has constructed more than 6,500 public-housing units. In December it passed radical reforms to planning laws, which will free up land and allow owners to build easily in their backyards. No other post-war government has done so much to reform the housing market, says Mr Eaqub, “But these are things that will take years to come to fruition.”</p><p class="article__body-text">The moves have not satisfied voters. More adults in New Zealand now rent than own their houses, says Mr Eaqub. Since the country has mostly been free of covid-19, the expense of housing is Kiwis’ biggest gripe: over half of them now list it as their top concern, according to Ipsos, a pollster. Their faith in Ms Ardern is sliding. That is the danger of promising miracles. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "Quarter-acre heartbreaker"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=New%20Zealand%E2%80%99s%20housing%20crisis%20is%20worsening&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-12&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fhg6boudb3no5fc9j882id2krr96no85f&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
