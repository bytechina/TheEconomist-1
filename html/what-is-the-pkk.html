Only hours after meetings got under way, <a href="./turkey-lifts-its-block-on-letting-sweden-and-finland-join-nato.html">Turkey lifted its objection</a> to Finland’s and Sweden’s applications to join the alliance. In exchange, the two <small>nato</small> hopefuls dropped a partial arms embargo against Turkey and promised to crack down on financing and recruitment by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (<small>pkk</small>), an armed Kurdish group. <a href="./recep-tayyip-erdogan-on-nato-expansion.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a>, Turkey’s president, had earlier threatened to spoil the welcome parade for the two Nordic countries, accusing them of harbouring terrorists. “While terrorist organisations are roaming the streets of Sweden and Finland, will we open our doors to them?” he said on June 15th. Who are the organisations Mr Erdogan has in mind?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, also known as the <small>PKK</small>, has been a thorn in Turkey’s side since 1984, when the group launched an insurgency. The ensuing conflict, which has featured attacks on Turkish army outposts, suicide-bombings and assassinations by the <small>PKK </small>on one side, and scorched-earth campaigns, enforced disappearances and widespread human-rights abuses by Turkey on the other, has claimed some 40,000 lives. The <small>PKK </small>fought at first in the name of an <a href="./why-kurds-are-losing-hope-of-having-their-own-state.html">independent Kurdistan</a> for the 30m Kurds scattered across Turkey and the Middle East. The group’s leaders now say they favour extensive autonomy. </p><p class="article__body-text">The war has raged mostly in south-east Turkey, where a majority of people are Kurds, and in the mountains of northern Iraq. Recently it has spilled into Syria. The <small>PKK</small>’s local offshoot, known as the People’s Defence Units, became the ground force in America’s war against Islamic State in 2015, and eventually brought down the self-described caliphate. The Kurds ended up in control of long swathes of Syrian land on the border with Turkey. Mr Erdogan has ordered three separate offensives against the guerrillas, accusing them of plotting attacks against Turkey. He recently mused about a fourth.</p><p class="article__body-text">America and the European Union, including Finland and Sweden, classify the <small>PKK </small>as a terrorist organisation. But Western countries do not see the group as a threat to their own security. To many Europeans, the <small>PKK</small>’s enduring appeal among Kurds reflects Turkey’s own democratic shortcomings. Kurdish pleas for cultural autonomy have gone unanswered for decades. Almost every main Kurdish political party to surface since the 1990s has been closed down by Turkish courts. The latest, the Peoples’ Democratic Party, may be banned from politics later this year, along with 451 of its members.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Well over 1m Kurds, many of them refugees, have settled in European countries other than Turkey. Finland is home to up to 18,000; as many as 100,000 live in Sweden. European countries have also become magnets for <small>PKK </small>loyalists, and are a focus of the group’s fundraising and recruitment efforts. Turkish officials, as well as many ordinary Turks, seethed on June 16th when Kurdish activists projected images of the <small>PKK</small>’s flag and of Abdullah Ocalan, the group’s imprisoned leader, on public buildings in Stockholm, Sweden’s capital. </p><p class="article__body-text">The row is fundamentally one over the meaning of terrorism. Kurdish politicians and activists in Turkey are routinely thrown into jail alongside militants. On June 16th 16 Kurdish journalists were arrested in Diyarbakir, a city in south-eastern Turkey, on vague terror charges. The list of people that Turkey wants extradited from Sweden includes writers and publishers. One of them has been dead for years.</p><p class="article__body-text">In Madrid, <small>nato</small> leaders persuaded Mr Erdogan to drop his veto in exchange for a few concessions, some concrete and some deliberately vague. But it will take many more years before Turkey and its <small>nato</small> allies can agree on the meaning of terrorism, and on the <small>pkk</small> and the Kurds.</p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./what-does-it-take-to-join-nato.html">What does it take to join NATO?</a><br/><a href="./where-will-ukraine-store-its-grain.html">Where will Ukraine store its grain?</a><br/><a href="./is-kaliningrad-russias-exclave-surrounded-by-eu-countries-an-asset-or-a-liability.html">Is Kaliningrad, Russia’s exclave surrounded by EU countries, an asset or a liability?</a></p></div></body></html>
