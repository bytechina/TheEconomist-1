On November 23rd Apple, a big smartphone-maker, announced that it would be suing <small>NSO</small> Group, an Israeli firm founded in 2010 and a one-time member of the unicorn club, accusing it of “weaponising powerful state-sponsored spyware” against its customers. It was the latest blow in an awful year for a firm which, despite the clandestine nature of its business, has become one of Israel’s best-known—and most controversial—companies.</p><p class="article__body-text">Whereas most cyber-security firms focus on defence, <small>NSO</small> Group sells hacking software to governments. Its best-known product, Pegasus, is designed to gain undetected access to smartphones. Targets can have their messages read, their locations tracked and microphones and cameras activated clandestinely.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><small>NSO</small> Group has said that it exports its software only to trusted governments. It says it has saved “thousands of lives” and is used to combat “terrorists and paedophiles”. Yet a list of 50,000 phone numbers considered for targeting, which leaked earlier this year, included those of Emmanuel Macron, France’s president; Roula Khalaf, the editor of the <em>Financial Times</em>; and hundreds of politicians, journalists and campaigners in dozens of countries, such as India, Mexico and Hungary.</p><p class="article__body-text">Apple is not the only company pursuing <small>NSO</small> Group through the courts. Its list of opponents reads like a “who’s who” of Silicon Valley firms. Last year Microsoft, Google, <small>VM</small>Ware and Cisco filed briefs in support of another lawsuit brought in 2019 by WhatsApp, a secure-messaging service owned by Meta, the parent company of Facebook. On November 8th an American court said that lawsuit could go ahead, ruling that <small>NSO</small> Group was not covered by the immunity to civil lawsuits enjoyed by national governments.</p><p class="article__body-text">Israel’s government has, until recently, backed the firm, using its capabilities as a way to boost ties with allies. After the leak of the target list, the government put out a determinedly dull statement assuring readers that export licences complied with international law. (In private some Israeli exporters ridiculed the outrage the leaks provoked.) The firm’s notoriety served as a sort of backhanded compliment to the technical abilities of Israel’s broader technology industry.</p><p class="article__body-text">But official support may be cooling as foreign governments join the chorus of displeasure, says John Scott-Railton of Citizen Lab, which is part of the University of Toronto and has done much of the technical-analysis work on Pegasus. On November 3rd America added <small>NSO</small> Group to the same sanctions list to which it has banished Huawei, a big Chinese telecoms firm, barring the use of American technology in <small>NSO</small> Group’s products. After Mr Macron’s name appeared on the leaked list, Israeli officials jumped on planes to Paris to try to smooth things over.</p><p class="article__body-text">The bad publicity seems to have been bad for business. On November 22nd Moody’s, a credit-rating agency, downgraded <small>NSO</small> Group’s debt to <small>CAA</small>2, one of the lowest grades available, and warned that it might default on $500m of loans. “<small>NSO</small> was seen as a win-win for both investors and Israel’s government so long as it wasn’t getting too much attention,” says Mr Scott-Railton. “But these days it looks like an investment that’s blowing up in everyone’s face.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "Hacked off"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20lawsuit%20from%20Apple%20piles%20pain%20on%20NSO%20Group&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-25&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fi6q1e51v9858p4nssqbluvcbomv643ng&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
