Large vats of rice bubble over open flames, filling the air with boozy fumes. The solution will be distilled into <em>awamori</em>, a liquor native to the islands of Okinawa, the most southern and western of Japan’s prefectures. Sakimoto Toshio, the distillery’s boss, pours out a sample of the stuff, which with an alcohol content of 60% is about half as strong again as a typical spirit. Your correspondent’s throat burns as it goes down.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/distillers-in-okinawa-are-trying-to-reinvent-the-local-firewater.mp3" title="Distillers in Okinawa are trying to reinvent the local firewater"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text"><em>Awamori</em> was invented in Okinawa in the 15th century. It uses long-grain rice and, to stimulate fermentation, black <em>koji</em> mould, distinguishing it from <em>shochu</em>, a better-known Japanese spirit invented in nearby Kyushu, which uses white <em>koji</em> and short-grain rice or other starches. The punch it packs reflects local conditions: its strength helped preserve the drink on the hot, humid islands in the days before refrigeration. The throat-burning 60% variant emerged on Yonaguni, Japan’s westernmost island, where Sakimoto is based. Known as <em>hanasake</em>, it is said to have started life as a disinfectant for medical use on ships, and later came to play a role in rituals such as funerals. When locals actually drink it, they usually cut it with ice and water and have it with roast pork.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text"><em>Awamori</em> has lately fallen on hard times. Two-thirds of the 45 members of Okinawa Awamori Distillers Association were in the red in 2020. Production volumes that year dipped by nearly 20%, the fourth straight year of decline. Younger Japanese are drinking less booze, and they prefer softer stuff or mixed drinks.</p><p class="article__body-text">That has forced the industry to experiment. Japan’s external trade organisation has sought to market <em>shochu</em>and <em>awamori</em>as premium drinks for discerning foreign tipplers, but few are biting (or sipping). Distillers have released flavoured <em>awamori</em> drinks, organised <em>awamori</em> festivals and enlisted influencers to appeal to younger consumers—with mixed results. Nakamura Shunki, a researcher at Okinawa’s manufacturing promotion office, reckons it helps if the drink looks Instagrammable.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Sakimoto has got the idea. He launched a collaboration with Rebun, Japan’s northernmost island, which supplies mineral water to make a “limited edition” <em>awamori</em>. The “<small>PR</small> effect” of bringing together Japan’s extreme north and west has helped sales, he says. Wisely, he also watered it down: its alcohol content is a more palatable 43%.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "Awamori?
