His biggest foe in this endeavour was not the bond vigilantes sending yields spiralling in Greece and Italy—they were soon cowed—but a sceptical colleague. Jens Weidmann, who as head of the Bundesbank was one of the strongest voices on the <small>ECB</small>’s governing council (where central-bank governors from euro-zone members sit), responded to Mr Draghi’s gambit with a homily on the dangers of money-printing drawn from Goethe’s <em>Faust</em>. He threatened to resign.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/21805770.mp3" title="Jens Weidmann steps down from the Bundesbank"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Nine years later, he has done so. On October 20th, just two years into his second eight-year term as Bundesbank president, Mr Weidmann unexpectedly announced that he would step down at the end of the year. His departing statement, which warned about the side-effects of loose monetary policy, hinted at his unhappiness about the <small>ECB</small>’s bond-buying. Mr Weidmann has long feared that the bank’s activism underplayed inflationary risks and eased pressure on indebted southern European countries to reform.</p><p class="article__body-text">Such positions often left Mr Weidmann in a hawkish minority. He had hoped to take over from Mr Draghi in 2019, but the <small>EU</small>’s leaders gave the job to Christine Lagarde, a former French finance minister. Mr Weidmann’s unease extended to the <small>ECB</small>’s decision later that year to restart quantitative easing. But he backed the results of the bank’s strategy review, as well as a €1.85trn ($2.15trn) bond-buying programme set up at the start of the pandemic, and Ms Lagarde’s growing focus on climate change. Sharp, well-briefed and courteous, Mr Weidmann found favour even among his doveish colleagues.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Mr Weidmann’s replacement at the Bundesbank will take over at a crucial moment. In December the <small>ECB</small> may confirm that its pandemic purchase scheme will expire in March. But the council is undecided on how much flexibility and firepower to grant an older bond-buying scheme in its place. Beyond that lie deeper divisions over how to interpret inflation, now running at 3.4% in the euro area. Rate rises are not imminent, but unease is growing—especially in Germany, where energy-price spikes are helping push inflation towards 5%.</p><p class="article__body-text">Germans who valued Mr Weidmann’s leanings lamented his decision. Others say his reluctance to defend the <small>ECB</small>’s policies to a sceptical German public sapped their potency. “A new head of the Bundesbank willing to take on Germany’s conservative consensus would help give the <small>ECB</small> cover in the critical months ahead,” says Christian Odendahl of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank in Berlin.</p><p class="article__body-text">Mr Weidmann delayed announcing his decision until after <a href="./olaf-scholzs-traffic-light-coalition-is-taking-shape.html">Germany’s election</a> in September. Appointing his replacement will fall to the next government. Possible names include Isabel Schnabel, a member of the <small>ECB</small>’s board; and Claudia Buch, Mr Weidmann’s deputy. The resignation injects an extra degree of complexity into the coalition talks just beginning in Berlin. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, <a data-analytics="in_body:link_1:para_10" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.economist.com/moneytalks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628284234418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGviR-zkpwefPKZAIJbeHx5M_SGCQ" href="./page-not-found.html">sign up to Money Talks</a>, our weekly newsletter.</em></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>An early version of this article was published online on October 20th 2021</em></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Finance &amp; economics section of the print edition under the headline "Hawk descending"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Jens%20Weidmann%20steps%20down%20from%20the%20Bundesbank&amp;publicationDate=2021-10-20&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fs7e961e3mkvvjhgbmg0j7i077h0pnrh6&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
