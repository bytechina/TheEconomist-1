Fans of “seasteading” talk of setting up self-governing hamlets in international waters, which would charge little or no tax. In 2019 Chad Elwartowski and Supranee Thepdet, an American and a Thai, spent time living in a small cabin floating some 12 miles off Thailand’s coast. The Thai government objected, towing away their “sea stead” soon after it was built.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/busan-a-south-korean-city-plans-a-floating-neighbourhood.mp3" title="Busan, a South Korean city, plans a floating neighbourhood"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Elsewhere in Asia governments see value in tempting people to live on water (but not to govern themselves). In November officials in Busan, a port in South Korea, said they planned to offer space for a floating neighbourhood that may be built near its shore. The project is endorsed by <small>UN-HABITAT</small>, a <small>UN</small> agency that deals with urbanisation. Itai Madamombe of Oceanix, the company that aims to fund and build the floating platform, says its prototype will cost around $200m and have room for 300-500 people. In theory, linking lots of these together could create a district that could house 10,000.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The idea is to demonstrate a tool cities might use to adapt to rising sea levels. Building floating city-blocks is arguably more sustainable than land reclamation, which requires masses of sand. Busan’s authorities seem to think the project will boost its shipbuilders. South Korean cities have a history of backing big infrastructure projects that may benefit local industry.</p><p class="article__body-text">One of Oceanix’s founders, Marc Collins Chen, previously ran a firm seeking to create a special economic zone in a Tahitian lagoon. (Some sea steaders recognise that living in international waters would be inconvenient and expensive; better to work with governments prepared to offer some autonomy in calm seas close to shore.) That project failed amid protest from locals, who did not relish the idea of an influx of tax-avoiders.</p><p class="article__body-text">There is no plan for residents of Busan’s floating neighbourhood to benefit from any special rules. Instead, the goals are technical: to find out if floating districts can be comfortable, affordable and scalable. These lessons may one day help people who still hope floating homes can help them escape the grabbing hand of the state. But not if governments get there first.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline "A stop in the ocean"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Busan%2C%20a%20South%20Korean%20city%2C%20plans%20a%20floating%20neighbourhood&amp;publicationDate=2021-12-04&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F8ln7ar4u19tt31iivd89m7spj7t70jej&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
