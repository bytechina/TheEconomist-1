Out of the windows I could see half-empty villages, the parched sepia bush. There were few other vehicles. Amid the calm, it was hard to imagine the turmoil this region has witnessed. </p><p class="article__body-text">In the early 2000s there were violent land invasions in this area, as there were in other parts of the country. Militants linked to the ruling party, <small>Zanu-PF</small>, evicted white farm-owners, and beat and murdered black farm-workers. They were acting under the orders of Robert Mugabe, the dictator who ruled for 37 years after independence until he was deposed in a coup in 2017.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">After an hour’s driving, I reached my destination: a farm called Esidakeni in an area known as Nyamandlovu, which means “the meat of the elephant”. The gates were open – there’s no point in locking them, said Charles Moyo, 58, who owns the farm with two friends, Siphosami Malunga and Zephaniah Dhlamini, also in their 50s. As he told me ruefully, many people come and go without a care for such niceties as property rights. </p><p class="article__body-text">On first impressions, all seemed well. Dozens of women were picking tomatoes for sale to supermarkets. They’re paid $5 a shift – a decent wage in a country where 60% of people live on $3 a day. But Moyo told me he couldn’t promise them a steady future. “You can’t plan when you are under siege.” In late 2020 Esidakeni was the scene of another invasion. But it wasn’t a white-owned farm the government wanted to seize; this time, the owners were black.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">S</span>ince the land invasions of the early 2000s, Zimbabwe’s economy has collapsed, a demise accelerated by vast corruption and Soviet-style economic policies.

He was a leading member of Zimbabwe African People’s Union, which fought against white rule alongside Mugabe’s party, but which, after independence, was seen as a threat to the new regime’s aim of one-party rule.</p><p class="article__body-text">Sydney Malunga was a courageous critic of the government, speaking out against the genocide in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when security forces loyal to Mugabe scorched huts, raped women and murdered children. (Locally, the killings are known as Gukurahundi, which loosely translates as “the early rains that wash away the chaff before the spring rains”.) Malunga was arrested on trumped-up charges of treason and tortured. Though he was eventually acquitted, he died in suspicious circumstances in 1994.</p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_02.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_02.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_02.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_03.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_03.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_03.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/954/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_04.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="954" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_04.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_04.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_05.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_05.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_05.jpg" width="1420"/></div><figcaption><b>Ripe with opportunity</b> <i>Opening image</i>: Charles Moyo walks through his tomato fields. <i>From top to bottom</i>: Despite the government’s actions, the three farmers are trying to keep the farm going.

Like his father, he is a trenchant defender of human rights. As a lawyer for the United Nations, he stood before judges in East Timor, worked to rebuild Afghanistan’s courts and cajoled African governments about human-rights abuses.</p><p class="article__body-text">But Malunga knew that he would return home one day. In 2013 he left the <small>UN</small> for a new job as head of the southern African branch of Open Society, an international <small>NGO</small> funded by George Soros that gives resources to local human-rights groups. He moved to Johannesburg but longed to buy a farm near his childhood home in Matabeleland, wanting to pass on something of the soil to his two children.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">He decided to club together with Dhlamini, a university friend who works as an academic, and Moyo, a successful local businessman and drinking buddy. In 2017 the three men paid $250,000 for Esidakeni, a working farm. Farming would be a hobby alongside their day jobs, and an opportunity to boost their pension pots. As Malunga put it when I met up with him in Johannesburg, the farm at Esidakeni gave him “the comfort of doing something I love…and [the chance to make] a shitload of money, too.” Soon they were bringing in tens of thousands of dollars selling cabbages, onions, tomatoes and butternut squash. </p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Those who benefited the most from repossessing white farms were Mugabe’s cronies</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">“We wanted to show that you can succeed as black farmers,” said Malunga. Though the pretext for repossessing white farms in the early 2000s was to return land to the black majority, those who benefited the most were Mugabe’s cronies in <small>Zanu-PF</small>, who amassed multiple properties. These apparatchiks proved incapable of running farms, so large swathes of land now lie fallow. </p><p class="article__body-text">Malunga knew that it was a risk to buy a farm, because of his background. Like his father, he has called for justice for the victims of the genocide in the 1980s. He has lambasted the corruption and thuggery of Zimbabwe’s government, both under Mugabe and Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s head of security during the Gukurahundi, who took power in the coup in 2017.</p><p class="article__body-text">When Dhlamini spotted the farm was for sale, Malunga’s response was, “Zanu will take it from us!” But since they were black farmers taking over a white-owned farm (as a thriving dairy farm, Esidakeni was deemed too important to seize in the 2000s), they felt that not even <small>Zanu-PF</small> would be vindictive enough to stop them. </p><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_06.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_06.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_06.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_07.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_07.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_07.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_08.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_08.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_08.jpg" width="1420"/></div></figure><figure><div itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1420/947/90/media-assets/image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_09.jpg" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" height="947" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_09.jpg" srcset="../image/1843_20220606_ZIMB_09.jpg" width="1420"/></div><figcaption><b>Reaping what they sow</b> (<i>from top to bottom</i>) The farmers discuss how to save what’s left of the tomato crop.

The men claim that in 2019 a senior official at the Central Intelligence Office, the spy agency once run by Zimbabwe’s president, warned them that Esidakeni would be taken unless Sipho toned down his rhetoric.

In another, the newcomers had built several two-room houses, though no one appeared to be living in them. He showed me the homestead, a large house built by the previous owners in a pastiche of the Cape Dutch style, all curved gables and faded white. The friends wanted to decorate, spruce it up for family gatherings. Wandering through the sparsely furnished rooms it seemed like a distant dream: the place was empty save for some beds, antelope horns and empty whisky bottles.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>Malunga likens the current government’s policies to the actions of Cecil Rhodes</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">In December the situation got even worse. Militiamen chased away the remaining farm workers and put an armed guard at the gate. The trio are taking the government to court to get their rights restored; the case is due to be heard later this year. In the meantime they are counting the costs of the invasions. Plans to resurrect dairy-farming have been postponed indefinitely. Tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of produce has rotted. </p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">I</span>n court papers, the government denies persecuting Malunga and claims it seized the farm because the men had broken the law by failing to inform the authorities about the sale, making the purchase unlawful (an allegation Malunga rejects).

In most African countries successful entrepreneurs would be celebrated, but Zimbabwe is no ordinary country</figcaption></figure><p class="article__body-text">For Sipho Malunga the case is both political and personal. The idea that the state can take land bought in a free marketplace is, he says, “an unnecessary intrusion on private property”. This makes a mockery of Mnangagwa’s claim that Zimbabwe is “open for business” after the Mugabe years.</p><p class="article__body-text">It also disrupts the transmission of black wealth. Malunga is proud that he finally owns land – something that was impossible for his father both under white rule and under <small>Zanu-PF</small>, which declared him an enemy of the state. “If I want to give my farm to my children I should be able to do that without the state having a veto,” he says. He likens the confiscations under <small>Zanu-PF</small> to the actions of Cecil Rhodes, the British imperialist who created a fiefdom that later became the colony of Rhodesia.</p><p class="article__body-text">Malunga knows that powerful people in Zimbabwe often get away with bullying. Most on the receiving end pay up. “People are beaten down in Zimbabwe,” he says. Mnangagwa is expected to run for re-election as president again next year, but races are usually rigged: “People feel so hopeless and desperate and helpless.” They feel that “<small>Zanu-PF</small> will always win, that they control everything.” He is challenging them, in part, because those less powerful cannot.</p><p class="article__body-cite"><cite>“We are black people. We are providing jobs and food. Why can’t they promote that?”</cite></p><p class="article__body-text">Although Malunga’s willingness to sue the state is brave and admirable, I couldn’t help but wonder whether his friends shared his stomach for the fight. One of the insidious things about authoritarian regimes is the way they poison the well of ordinary joys, such as friendship. The men claim the government has tried to turn them against each other by saying that Dhlamini and Moyo could keep the farm if they dumped Malunga.</p><p class="article__body-text article__body-text--dropcap" data-caps="initial"><span data-caps="initial">B</span>efore visiting the farm, I met Dhlamini and Moyo on the terrace of a nearby hotel: the furnishings looked like there’d been an explosion at a Laura Ashley factory and photographs of Rhodes were proudly displayed. Moyo seemed the more phlegmatic. He is comfortably off (he has stakes in small gold mines) and refuses to give up. “They have tried to divide us,” he said, “but we told ourselves we’d fight together.” In any case, he added, “we’re friends and there would be life after the farm.” </p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Dhlamini, by contrast, was stressed. Like many Zimbabweans I have met in years of reporting in the country, he is talented, driven and darkly humorous, but worn down by the reality of trying to get by. “This is a big deal,” he said, when I asked how much of his own family’s money he’d put into the farm. “This is all we have. That’s basically all we put in there.”</p><p class="article__body-text">“I was telling Charles [Moyo] yesterday that I’m really tired,” he said. “This is taking a toll on me. There’s nothing that I can think about any more other than this.” For him, there is an enduring sense of shock at how low the ruling party has sunk. “We are black people. We are investing in our country. We are employing our own people. We are providing jobs. We are providing food. Why can’t they promote that?” </p><p class="article__body-text">I asked about the “sinister” promises he says have been made by the government – that if he and Moyo got rid of Malunga, their problems would go away. Was he tempted? Dhlamini laughed and turned to Moyo: “Maybe it’s high time we did!” </p><p class="article__body-text">I studied his face, trying to see if there was a genuine uncertainty amid the mirth. But I couldn’t see it. Seriously, he said, “you can’t victimise someone to that extent because of their views. It’s just not right. It’s not ethical.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>John McDermott</b> is <i>The Economist</i>’s chief Africa correspondent</p><p class="article__body-text"><small>PHOTOGRAPHS <b>ILAN GODFREY</b></small></p></div></body></html>
