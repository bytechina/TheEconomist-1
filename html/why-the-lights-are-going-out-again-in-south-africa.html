South Africans these days are more interested in the outlook for rolling blackouts. One of the country’s most-downloaded apps provides alerts and schedules for power outages. Eskom, the state power monopoly, cannot generate enough electricity to meet demand, and is deploying a byzantine system of rotating outages known as “load-shedding”, so as to avoid the collapse of the entire grid. Last year saw the most blackouts in South African history, overtaking 2020; and this year is set to beat the record again. On June 28th, for only the second time, “stage 6” load-shedding was implemented, which would mean several outages over a 24-hour period. Many businesses have bought generators or solar-power systems; others close during outages. In big cities, there is chaos at rush hour as traffic lights go dark. The blackouts suit copper-cable thieves, who can steal without fear of electrocution. And when the electricity is switched back on, substations sometimes explode, resulting in secondary outages. Why can’t South Africa keep the lights on?</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The latest power cuts have been exacerbated by an unauthorised strike by workers at Eskom. That action occurred while power stations amounting to around 40% of total generating capacity have broken down. Part of the reason, says Andre de Ruyter, Eskom’s chief executive, is sabotage by criminal gangs out to pilfer fuel and materials. Two big coal-fired stations, Kusile and Medupi, remain dysfunctional years after they were due to be fully operational, as well as being hugely over budget. Eskom is beset by allegations of corruption and mismanagement, as shown by a recent judge-led <a href="./the-zondo-commission-has-revealed-vast-graft-in-south-africa.html">inquiry into corruption</a> under Jacob Zuma, the former president. Even if the current strike is sorted out, fundamental problems will remain.</p><p class="article__body-text">The company’s troubles have their roots in the shift from apartheid. South Africa’s power grid was designed to serve the white minority and the desire for industrial self-sufficiency in the face of international sanctions. After the first democratic elections in 1994, the new government, led by the African National Congress (<small>ANC</small>), connected poor black areas to the grid. Massive expansion was needed to meet surging demand. But successive governments dawdled over adding new capacity while Eskom was looted through graft. Its Soviet-style structure, whereby Eskom generates, transmits and distributes electricity, means that there is little market pressure to improve. Its problems have been aggravated by the fact that many South Africans do not pay for their electricity. Municipalities are often in arrears, some people steal electricity through illegal connections and others view electricity as something that the <small>ANC </small>should provide free of charge. The cost of electricity has duly risen, demand has now shrunk and some richer households have gone off the grid altogether. Eskom’s workforce has exploded thanks in part to “cadre deployment”, where cronies are given jobs on the basis of loyalty, even though many skilled staff have responded to the drop in morale and the company’s increasing politicisation by leaving.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Eskom is in many ways symbolic of South Africa’s fall from the heady days of the 1990s. It is also indicative of how <small>ANC </small>governments have squandered huge opportunities. The country—not short of sunshine, waves or wind—ought to be at the forefront of Africa’s push for renewable energy, yet Eskom’s coal-fired power stations account for about a quarter of all carbon emissions in sub-Saharan Africa. Mr de Ruyter has an ambitious plan to stop load shedding by plugging these new sources into the grid—and there is foreign aid to help relieve Eskom’s huge debts, too. The problem, as ever, is the ruling party. Gwede Mantashe, the energy minister (and coal advocate), who the corruption inquiry has said could be the subject of potential prosecution, has blocked many <a href="./south-africa-the-worlds-coal-junkie-tries-to-quit.html">attempts at reform</a>. President Cyril Ramaphosa sees Mr Mantashe as too important in the internal politics of the <small>ANC </small>to warrant sacking. As a result of this cynical incompetence South Africans are increasingly likely to vote against the <small>ANC </small>at the next elections. Even if they must do so by candlelight.</p><p class="article__body-text"><i><b>Editor’s note</b>: A version of this article <a href="./why-the-lights-keep-going-out-in-south-africa.html">was published</a> in 2019. </i></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./how-is-the-supreme-court-changing-the-law-of-religious-liberty-in-america.html">How is the Supreme Court changing the law of religious liberty in America?</a><br/><a href="./where-will-ukraine-store-its-grain.html">Where will Ukraine store its grain?</a><br/><a href="./what-is-the-doom-loop-in-the-euro-zone.html">What is the “doom loop” in the euro zone?</a></p></div></body></html>
