A tight-fisted government was one impetus for the venture, which aimed to raise money for Britain’s ailing ports. Enticements for ticket-holders included freedom from arrest for a week (though only for petty crimes), and prizes worth up to £5,000 paid in cash, plate, tapestries and “good linen cloth”. Yet so few people bought the expensive tickets that the top prize had to be trimmed to a 12th of this offering—and loans had to finance the ports.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <span class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</span></div><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/running-britains-national-lottery-is-not-as-easy-as-it-was.mp3" title="Running Britain's national lottery is not as easy as it was"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p class="article__body-text">When today’s national lottery launched in November 1994, advertising was easier, trust in the organisers was higher and buying tickets was cheaper. It has since raised tens of billions for good causes and produced over 6,300 millionaires. Measured by numbers of players, it is Britain’s most popular form of gambling. In March the Gambling Commission will decide whether it should change hands. Camelot, which has had the operating licence since 1994, and other bidders, must contend with some fresh challenges. Over 500 years running a lottery may have become easier. But over the past 27 it has become harder.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Modern lottery operators must play their cards carefully. The aim is to sell a little to enough people so as to raise lots of money for good causes—and still make a profit. But they are meant not to pursue punters so aggressively that they feed addiction. And they face relatively nimble competition. Online betting platforms track customer data and can change their offerings quickly to see what works. Yet half of those buying traditional national lottery tickets do so in person.</p><p class="article__body-text">The competition is visible in the figures. Sales in the 2019-20 financial year were 16% higher than in 2009-10 (adjusted for inflation). But whereas in 2009-10 spending on the national lottery took 30% of the gambling industry’s yield, by 2019-20 its share had fallen to 24%. Surveys suggest that participation has declined. One in 1999 covering England, Scotland and Wales found that some 65% of adults had bought a ticket for the draw over the previous year. Another covering only England 20 years later found that the share playing a national lottery draw or scratchcard was down to 44%. Over the past decade younger players seem to have dropped away the most. (A spokesperson for Camelot claims that last year 68% of British adults played the national lottery.)</p><p class="article__body-text">Some efforts to attract more players have disappointed. In October 2015 they were asked to match six of 59 balls instead of 49 in the core “lotto” game, dramatically increasing the chance that nobody would win the big prize, rolling the jackpot over to the next draw. That was supposed to exploit a tendency to appreciate large prizes more than low probabilities. (Two-thirds of those playing the national lottery say they do it because of the big prizes.) But the change did not prevent a subsequent drop in ticket sales for that game.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">After efforts to highlight the good causes the lottery supports, it has seen sales growth for the past three years. Draws starting in 1994 were weekly, with winning numbers announced on television every Saturday. Now there is a draw every night except Sunday, with the process streamed live over the internet. In March 2019 came the introduction of the “Set for Life” draw, which pays winners £10,000 ($13,500) for 30 years—though the odds of winning the top prize are slim at one in 15,339,390. Younger people should feel more confident they will live that long.</p><div class="article__body-text-image"><figure><div data-slim="1" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220226_BRC377.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="300px" src="../image/20220226_BRC377.png" srcset="../image/20220226_BRC377.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Another innovation has been scratch cards and other games that offer immediate payouts. Buy a ticket online for a lottery draw, and you may see an offer to play “Cashword Multiplier”, a game requiring disappointingly little skill in which players click on letters to win instant cash prizes. In 2009-10, draw-based games accounted for 76% of the national lottery’s revenue, with scratch cards and instant-win games contributing the rest. Between April and September 2021, the share of draw-based games was down to 56%. A spokesperson for Camelot says that “sales of instants are largely incremental and don’t come at the expense of draw-based games.”</p><p class="article__body-text">This shift has proved controversial. Luring players away from competing offers has meant offering juicier payouts. But that has squeezed the share of sales going to good causes, from 25% in 2008-09 to 21% in 2020-21. In 2018 the Public Accounts Committee criticised Camelot’s operating licence for inflexibility in the face of changes in players’ behaviour. The regulators have taken notice. In 2020 the Gambling Commission promised that the next operator would have a “restructured incentive mechanism” to align the licensee’s desire to make a profit with its ability to raise money for good causes.</p><p class="article__body-text">Four other firms now hope to oust Camelot as the national lottery’s operator. Since all bidders are barred from talking about their proposals, it is hard to know what the winner might do differently. Warwick Bartlett of Global Betting &amp; Gaming Consultants, a consultancy, notes that national lotteries rarely change hands. But after holding the licence for almost 30 years, there are already suggestions that, if Camelot wins again, it may face a legal challenge from its rivals. For all the problems linked to running a lottery, the rewards are high—and worth a flutter. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline "Eyes on the prize"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=Running%20Britain's%20national%20lottery%20is%20not%20as%20easy%20as%20it%20was&amp;publicationDate=2022-02-25&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F0eelk4i0mbh0et4m29d3ssubmmcu4onf&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
