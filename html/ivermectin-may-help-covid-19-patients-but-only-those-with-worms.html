At last count doctors in America prescribed more than 100,000 tablets of the drug a week, a 30-fold increase since 2019. Ivermectin’s advocates insist that there is solid science showing its efficacy. One website lists 67 papers on the subject. Could they all be wrong? Recent analysis suggests ivermectin probably does help one subset of covid patients: those also infected by the worms it was designed to fight.</p><p class="article__body-text">Wading through the papers whose methodologies seemed sound (many were not), Avi Bitterman, a dermatologist, noticed that the studies that looked best for ivermectin clustered in regions with high rates of infections by strongyloides, parasitic worms. Common in Africa, Asia and Latin America, strongyloides can cause diarrhoea, fatigue and weight loss. They pose a graver threat only if their numbers grow out of control. Such “hyper-infection”, often fatal, becomes far more likely if a patient is receiving corticosteroids, which suppress the immune system and may make female worms more fertile. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, is now a standard treatment for severe covid-19.</p><figure><div data-slim="0" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/946/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211127_USC944.png" itemprop="url"/><img alt="" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" src="../image/20211127_USC944.png" srcset="../image/20211127_USC944.png"/></div></figure><p class="article__body-text">Building on observations by David Boulware, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota, Dr Bitterman concluded that strongyloides may account for the conflicting results of studies about the effectiveness of ivermectin as a covid treatment. In trials conducted where the parasites are common, many people could have both covid and worm infections. Covid-19 might have weakened their defences against the worms; treating the coronavirus with corticosteroids would let the parasites run wild.</p><p class="article__body-text">“Ivermectin doesn’t treat covid,” Dr Bitterman wrote. “It treats parasites (shocker) that kill people when they get steroids that treat covid.”</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">In July 2020 a group of doctors argued in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> that it was “reasonable to consider presumptive treatment with ivermectin for moderate- to high-risk patients not previously tested or treated for strongyloides”, and said that the risk of infection by the worms should be “based on factors such as country of origin and long-term residence”. The World Health Organisation also recommends ivermectin in this context.</p><p class="article__body-text">But most people in rich Western countries like America do not fit this description. For treating covid-19 patients who have never been to places with widespread strongyloides, this evidence suggests that doctors, and the <small>FDA</small>, should not recommend ivermectin.</p><p class="article__body-text"><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p class="article__body-text"><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic can be found on our <a href="./page-not-found.html">coronavirus hub</a>.
