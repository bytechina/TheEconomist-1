After an elaborate process of fermentation, the smell is essential to its flavour. <em>Iru </em>is further enriched once tossed in smoky, bleached palm oil.</p><div class="article-audio-player"><figure class="article-audio-player__figure"><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio class="react-audio-player" controls="" controlslist="nodownload" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="../audio/a-tangy-nigerian-cooking-ingredient-is-cheering-the-diaspora.mp3" title="A tangy Nigerian cooking ingredient is cheering the diaspora"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p class="article-audio-player__cta">Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" id="audio-ios-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" id="audio-android-cta" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Android</a>.</p></div><p class="article__body-text">Long before Nestlé came to Nigeria with its Maggi bouillon cubes, <em>iru </em>was flavouring soups, stews and rice dishes. After independence the cube, with its monosodium glutamate seasoning, became more popular than <em>iru</em>, particularly in cities. But <em>iru </em>is making a worldwide comeback, thanks to a dish called <em>ayamase </em>which is packed with it.</p><p class="article__body-text">A decade ago you would have been hard-pressed to find <em>ayamase </em>on a party menu. Instead you might have found <em>ofada</em>, a dish named after a town in south-western Nigeria close to Lagos, the commercial capital. It consists of unpolished rice and a spicy fried red-pepper beef stew. But now <em>ayamase, </em>the green-pepper rival of <em>ofada</em>, is wherever you find Nigerians, at home or abroad.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline" id=""><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">Bilikisu Raji, who lives in Ibadan, another big city in the south-west, was taught to ferment <em>iru </em>by her mother-in-law. The <em>iru </em>enterprise is run by women because, she jokes in Yoruba, the men aren’t up to it. She buys the yellow-tinged seeds in the market and boils them for 12 hours in a cauldron. She removes the chaff to reveal black-brown beans, peels them with the balls of her feet, washes them through a sieve, then boils them again. Eventually she dry-roasts them and covers them with a raffia tray to let them ferment overnight. Finally she rubs the <em>iru </em>in salt, then rolls it up in dry leaves, ready to sell. A small wrap weighing 20 grams goes for only 50 naira (an American dime). She survives on the patronage of foreign customers who buy as much as $25-worth at a time to use in <em>ayamase </em>abroad.</p><p class="article__body-text">Nowadays you can find <em>iru </em>on shelves across the world. Ms Sokoh, who has lived in the Netherlands and Canada, has seen it in shops everywhere. “You find frozen <em>iru</em>, fresh <em>iru</em>, powdered <em>iru</em>, dried <em>iru</em> on the shelves in ways you couldn’t ten years ago,” she says. Suffering from high blood pressure, she steers clear of stock cubes in favour of <em>iru</em>. “There’s definitely a saltiness without being sodium-heavy,” she says.</p><p class="article__body-text">To non-West Africans, <em>iru </em>is likely to remain a niche ingredient “like fish sauce”, sighs Tunde Wey, a popular Nigerian chef based in New Orleans. He has collaborated with an American company to sell <em>iru </em>in sleek jars, hoping to boost small farmers back home while getting fellow cooks abroad to appreciate its versatility. Whether or not Western foodies catch on to this superbean rich in probiotics, <em>iru </em>is fuelling Nigerian partygoers around the world.</p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "Locust beans are back"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20tangy%20Nigerian%20cooking%20ingredient%20is%20cheering%20the%20diaspora&amp;publicationDate=2021-07-31&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2F4rrfrgptfdu9ush0uqtm71dsttp4e71n&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
