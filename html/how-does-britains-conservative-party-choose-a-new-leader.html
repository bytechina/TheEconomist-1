The victor will become prime minister. That means Britain can change its leader without the bother of a general election. Indeed, the last time that an election directly led to a change of prime minister was 2010. After Theresa May resigned between elections in 2019, Mr Johnson saw off other Tories to succeed her, as Mrs May did after David Cameron quit three years before. The leader who can command a majority in the House of Commons is asked by the monarch to form a government, however they end up in that position. The Conservatives retain a majority of 75, so whoever wins the leadership of the party will also govern the country. How will that leadership election work?</p><p class="article__body-text">Candidates must be a Conservative MP, and win the nomination of at least 20 colleagues by 6pm on July 12th. Party rules set out two stages of the competition. First, candidates vie for the approval of fellow Tory MPs. In consecutive rounds of voting, candidates are eliminated until only two remain. Their names are then put forward to the <a href="./who-are-the-members-of-the-conservative-party.html">roughly 180,000 members</a> of the party. These happy stalwarts then decide who gets the job.</p><p class="article__body-text"><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PECy4bE9zg4?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p class="article__body-text">The contest that took Mr Johnson to power lasted around two months. This time is likely to be similar; the new leader will be in place by September 5th. Some ministers and MPs have made it plain that they want to <a href="./boris-johnson-should-go-immediately.html">see the back of Mr Johnson</a> much earlier. On July 7th Sir John Major, a former party leader and prime minister, suggested that the rules could revert to the old system—under which he succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990—by which only MPs pick the new leader, thus saving time. But when the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, which oversees the contest, met on July 11th it decided against such a drastic change to its rules. </p><p class="article__body-text">So far 11 MPs have said they are running, though Grant Shapps, the transport minister, has since pulled out. Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, is <a href="./who-will-replace-boris-johnson.html">the frontrunner</a>. It now falls to Conservative MPs to narrow the field. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__body-text"><b>More from <i>The Economist</i> explains:</b><br/><a href="./who-are-the-members-of-the-conservative-party.html">Who are the members of the Conservative Party?</a><br/><a href="./why-hasnt-the-british-economy-grown-faster.html">Why hasn’t the British economy grown faster?</a><br/><a href="./what-is-stagflation-and-might-it-make-a-comeback.html">What is stagflation, and might it make a comeback?</a></p></div></body></html>
