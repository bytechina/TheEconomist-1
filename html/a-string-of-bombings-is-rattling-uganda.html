They were quick to blame “radicalised groups” linked to the Allied Democratic Forces (<small>ADF</small>), a rebel outfit based in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Islamic State (<small>IS</small>), which counts the <small>ADF</small> among its affiliates, later said that it was behind the attacks.</p><p class="article__body-text">The bombings did not come out of the blue. Last month a waitress was killed by a blast in a Kampala bar, for which <small>IS</small> also claimed responsibility. Two days later a man detonated a bomb on a bus, killing only himself. More tenuously, the government has blamed the <small>ADF</small> for a string of attacks on public figures, including an assassination attempt in June on a government minister and former army commander. Those shootings, carried out by men on motorcycles, followed a different pattern from the recent bombings. The evidence linking them to the <small>ADF</small> seems shaky.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">The <small>ADF</small> was born in the 1990s in a marriage of convenience between Islamist rebels and ethnic separatists from the Rwenzori mountains straddling the border with Congo. It mounted several bomb attacks in Uganda before decamping to lawless eastern Congo, pursued by Uganda’s army. It found a niche there among a patchwork of rival militias, looting villages and smuggling timber. At one point it had shrunk to just a few dozen fighters.</p><p class="article__body-text">The <small>ADF</small> is plainly making a comeback. Last year it killed at least 800 Congolese civilians and forced thousands to flee their homes. In one attack this month it massacred 38 people in the Congolese town of Beni, slitting their throats or burning them alive. It has been reinvigorated by a growing network of recruits across east Africa, who share bomb-making skills and may be inspired by wider Islamist influences. Last year Musa Seka Baluku, leader of one <small>ADF</small> faction, declared that his group was now the “Central Africa Province of Islamic State”. In March the American government designated it a foreign terrorist organisation and an <small>IS</small> affiliate.</p><p class="article__body-text">It is not yet certain whether the <small>ADF</small> has operational links to <small>IS</small>. A report by <small>UN</small> experts in June found no conclusive evidence that <small>IS</small> had command over it, or provided “financial, human or material” support. But jihadist propaganda that links the two groups has raised the <small>ADF’</small>s profile and lets <small>IS</small> boast of an ever-wider global reach.</p><p class="article__body-text">Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, also has an interest in playing up the threat. He has long positioned himself as an ally in the global war on terror, securing financial and military support from Western governments which has helped him prolong his authoritarian rule.</p><div class="advert incontent hidden advert--inline"><div><div class="adcontainer" id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p class="article__body-text">“The <small>ADF</small> originally grew out of a feeling of marginalisation among the Muslim community of Uganda,” says Kristof Titeca of the University of Antwerp, noting that the government has sometimes made that problem worse. A notorious anti-terrorism police unit has a record of abducting and torturing Muslims, some of whom have died in custody. After this week’s bombings Mr Museveni boasted of the recent extrajudicial killings of seven men who he says were linked to the <small>ADF</small>. Tellingly, he signed off with the nickname his supporters gave him in the civil war that brought him to power: Ssabalwanyi, meaning “Greatest of fighters”. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p class="article__footnote" data-test-id="Footnote">This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline "Whodunnit?"</p><div class="layout-article-links layout-article-promo"><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--reuse-this-content" href="https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&amp;publication=economist&amp;title=A%20string%20of%20bombings%20is%20rattling%20Uganda&amp;publicationDate=2021-11-18&amp;contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fudutnj0jbfgqlfha86sisfcf2ujccqlf&amp;type=A&amp;orderBeanReset=TRUE" target="_blank"><span>Reuse this content</span></a><a class="ds-actioned-link ds-actioned-link--the-trust-project" href="https://www.economist.com/frequently-asked-questions"><span>The Trust Project</span></a></div></div></body></html>
